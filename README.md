# VulnoraIQ

**VulnoraIQ** is a Docker-first, self-hosted testing lab for authorised local or internal use with a browser GUI, CLI, reports, evidence, and CI validation workflows.

VulnoraIQ is a **self-hosted internal application**. The same scope covers an **internal server** deployment when production auth, reverse proxy, TLS, audit, and backup controls are configured. The current release claim is scoped: **self-hosted laptop/server AI security testing application with controlled internal production-readiness gate passed**. Findings are framework evidence for human review, not certified VAPT-grade assurance. See [`docs/ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md`](docs/ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md).

## Current status

| Area | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Version | `0.2.0` beta |
| GUI/WebUI | Yes. Browser-based React console served by `vulnoraiq-web` / `webui/hosted_server.py`. |
| Experimental Agent Lab | Yes. `/agent-lab` imports real AI-agent projects, configures LLM provider settings, selects CPU/GPU Docker runtime options, builds/runs the agent, auto-creates a target, and launches an authorised scan. See [`docs/AGENT_LAB.md`](docs/AGENT_LAB.md). |
| Default posture | Local laptop/workstation Docker Compose lab with loopback-only WebUI publishing. |
| Persistence | SQLite job store with WAL mode, foreign keys, busy timeout, and schema versioning. |
| Future identity | Direct OIDC/JWT is deferred; see `docs/future-plans/OIDC_JWT_AUTH_PLAN.md`. |

## Prerequisites

Choose the path you want to run.

| Run path | Required before starting |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended Docker GUI lab | Docker Engine or Docker Desktop with Docker Compose v2, internet access for the first image/dependency build, and a modern browser such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari. |
| Double-click launchers | Docker Desktop or compatible Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2. The `.bat`, `.command`, and `.sh` files are the startup entry points and run Docker build/start/health/browser steps directly. No host Python install is required for this path. |
| Experimental Agent Lab | Docker lab prerequisites plus local Docker build/run access. GPU mode requires host GPU container support. Local Ollama/LM Studio providers should listen on the host and are reached through `host.docker.internal`. |
| Source/package install | Python 3.10 or newer, `pip`, `venv`, Git for source checkouts, and a modern browser. |
| Local wheel build | Python 3.10 or newer plus the release extra: `pip install -e .[release]`. |
| WebUI development/tests | Node.js 20 or newer, npm, and Playwright browser dependencies. End users do not need Node.js when using Docker, release packages, or the Python package. |

Before running any target, prepare explicit authorisation, target credentials through environment variables, owner/contact details, and an approved safety profile. The default Docker GUI lab binds the WebUI to `127.0.0.1:8787` and is intended for local single-user use.

## Quick start

Recommended local GUI path with Docker Compose. This does not install VulnoraIQ into your host Python environment.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Open the GUI/WebUI in your browser: <http://localhost:8787>.

The WebUI is published on host loopback only: `127.0.0.1:8787:8787`.

To use the experimental Agent Lab, open <http://localhost:8787/agent-lab> after the Docker lab is running.

### Double-click launchers

For normal laptop/workstation use, the launcher files are now the point of start:

| Platform | Launcher |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.bat` |
| macOS | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.command` |
| Linux | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.sh` |

Each launcher performs the full startup sequence:

1. check Docker is installed and running;
2. run `docker compose build`;
3. run `docker compose up -d`;
4. show `docker compose ps`;
5. wait for `vulnoraiq-web` health;
6. open <http://127.0.0.1:8787> in the default browser.

Useful Docker commands:

```bash
docker compose exec vulnoraiq-web vulnoraiq targets list
docker compose exec vulnoraiq-web vulnoraiq reports list
docker compose exec vulnoraiq-web vulnoraiq jobs list
```

Cleanly close the Docker lab:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Only use this when you intentionally want to delete local jobs, reports, evidence, audit data, Agent Lab imports, and Docker volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Restart later:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Install from a source/package checkout and run locally without Docker:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev]
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8787>. Cleanly close with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that started `vulnoraiq-web`.

Build and install a local wheel package:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[release]
python -m build
pip install dist/vulnoraiq-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

If a package-index release is published later:

```bash
pip install vulnoraiq
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

## WebUI and CLI

The supported GUI is the built React console under `webui/static/console/`; the source app lives in `webui/console/`. It is a browser GUI, not a native desktop window. The experimental Agent Lab static assets live under `webui/static/agent-lab/`.

The double-click launchers are Docker-only startup entry points. They do not create a Python virtual environment and do not require Python on the host.

You can also run the Python launcher directly from a source checkout when using the Python-based local path:

```bash
python launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py
```

Close launcher mode with the WebUI **Stop local server** control when available, or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that started it.

## Deployment and security boundary

Local Docker and launcher paths are for single-user controlled use. Shared/internal-server deployment requires production configuration validation, real secrets, TLS at a trusted reverse proxy, audit retention, backups, and authorised target governance.

Agent Lab is experimental because it can build and run imported code through local Docker. Keep it loopback-only unless production auth, reverse proxy/TLS, audit, and an explicit risk decision are in place.

```bash
export VULNORAIQ_ENV=production
export VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true
export VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_BACKEND=sqlite
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_PATH=/data/jobs.db
export VULNORAIQ_WEB_OUTPUT_ROOT=/data/reports
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Use trusted reverse-proxy identity only when the proxy authenticates users and strips spoofed identity headers. Direct OIDC/JWT remains future work, not a blocker for current local single-user usage.

## Validation and release gates

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
pytest -q
python -m pip check
pip-audit
python scripts/validate_package_metadata.py
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py --output-dir reports/output/production-readiness
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
```

WebUI browser flow:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
npm run test:webui:hosted
```
