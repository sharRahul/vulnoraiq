## Docker-first safe lab status

VulnoraIQ is now configured as a Docker-first, self-hosted AI-agent security testing lab. Real target validation, scan execution, mock-agent traffic, evidence capture, report generation, and automated checks are expected to run inside Docker Compose by default. The host should only run Docker commands, open the WebUI at `http://localhost:8787`, and read explicitly exported reports.

Quick start:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

CLI examples must be run inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec vulnoraiq-web vulnoraiq targets validate --target local_mock_agent
docker compose exec vulnoraiq-web vulnoraiq scan --target local_mock_agent --profile ai_agent_foundation --authorised
```

See `docs/DOCKER_TESTING.md`, `docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md`, `docs/TARGET_CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/AI_AGENT_TESTING.md`, `docs/WEBUI_GUIDE.md`, and `docs/CLI_GUIDE.md`.

# VulnoraIQ

**VulnoraIQ** is a self-hosted AI security assessment application for authorised testing of **LLM applications, RAG pipelines, AI agents, tool-using systems, GenAI data flows, vector stores, providers, telemetry, reports, and orchestration layers**.

It is designed to run on a **laptop, workstation, lab machine, or internal server** so security teams can test AI agents and LLM applications they own or are explicitly authorised to assess.

VulnoraIQ helps teams collect evidence, score findings, generate reports, and track OWASP LLM / OWASP GenAI / OWASP AI Testing Guide / Agentic / MITRE ATLAS coverage as the framework matures.

## Responsible-use boundary

Use VulnoraIQ only against systems you own or are explicitly authorised to assess.

The default `demo` target is safe and local. Configured non-demo targets require an explicit authorisation flag. Do not run assessments against third-party systems without written permission.

## Home screen

The screenshot below is the VulnoraIQ Web UI home screen, captured from the running console. It shows the startup and local-server-controls panel, the test selection and run-readiness form, realtime progress, the completed-assessment dashboard area, and recent scan history on a single page.

## Quick start: local demo

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]

vulnoraiq --target demo --profile baseline
```

The demo target uses an in-memory echo client and does not call external services.

---

## Run the Web UI: double-click launcher

For local self-hosted use you do not need to remember any commands. After a one-time
`pip install -e .` (or `pip install -e .[dev]`), double-click the launcher for your
platform from the repository root:

| Platform | Double-click file |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.bat` |
| macOS | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.command` |
| Linux | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.sh` |
| Any platform (Python) | `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py` |

The launcher runs the same steps for every platform:

1. Runs **startup dependency checks** (Python version, `PyYAML`, `requests`, `rich`,
   core package modules, target/profile configuration, Web UI assets, output directory,
   and the SQLite job store).
2. Performs **quick-start actions** — ensures the local output directory and SQLite job
   store exist, binds to loopback for safe local assessment, and opens the console in your
   default browser.
3. Opens [`http://127.0.0.1:8787/`](http://127.0.0.1:8787/) automatically once the server
   is healthy.

The startup panel inside the Web UI shows the live results of those checks, the current
**configuration options** (host, port, output root, job store, auth) and how to change
each one, plus a **Stop local server** button so you can shut the server down cleanly from
the browser without returning to the terminal.


You can override the defaults when launching from a terminal:

```bash
python launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888   # custom port
python launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py --no-browser                   # start without opening a browser
```

The launcher runs in local development mode with authentication disabled and the in-browser
stop control enabled. It is intended for laptop/workstation use on loopback only; for an
exposed or shared deployment use the self-hosted startup below.

---

## How to use the application

Once the console is open in your browser:

1. **Check startup readiness.** The *Startup and local server controls* panel at the top
   shows the dependency and quick-start checks. A green **Ready for local assessment** badge
   means you can run scans. Use **Refresh checks** to re-run them at any time.
2. **Choose what to run.** In *Choose tests and run scan*, pick a **Target** (start with the
   safe local `demo` target) and a **Test option** — either a full assessment suite or a
   single focused OWASP LLM / OWASP AI Testing Guide / RAG / agentic test from the categorised catalogue. The
   *Run readiness* panel summarises exactly what will run before you start.
3. **Authorise configured targets.** The `demo` target needs no authorisation. For any
   configured non-demo target you must tick the authorisation checkbox confirming you own
   or are explicitly authorised to assess it.
4. **Start the assessment** with **Start selected assessment** and watch the *Realtime
   progress* panel update live (initialising → scanning → policy → dashboard → completed).
5. **Review the dashboard.** When the scan completes, the *Completed assessment dashboard*
   shows summary cards, top risks, the severity distribution, policy evaluation, and a
   filterable findings list with evidence previews.
6. **Export outputs.** Download the Markdown, JSON, SARIF, Markdown dashboard, and HTML
   dashboard artifacts from the *Outputs for presentation* section.
7. **Stop the server** when you are done with the red **Stop local server** button in the
   startup panel — the local server shuts down cleanly and the launcher window exits.

To test an actual local AI agent, run the agent on one of the documented loopback contracts and select one of the `owasp_lab_*` targets. See [`docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE_INTEGRATION.md).

## Web UI: self-hosted startup

Production mode fails closed if required controls are missing or unsafe.

```bash
export VULNORAIQ_ENV=production
export VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true
export VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_BACKEND=sqlite
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_PATH=/data/jobs.db
export VULNORAIQ_WEB_OUTPUT_ROOT=/data/reports

python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

### Stopping the Web UI server

If you started the Web UI with a double-click launcher, use the **Stop local server** button in the startup panel of the console to shut it down cleanly from the browser.

If the Web UI is running in the foreground, stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `vulnoraiq-web` is running.

If it was started in the background, find the process that is listening on port `8787` and terminate it:

```bash
lsof -ti :8787 | xargs kill
```

Use a forced kill only if the process does not stop cleanly:

```bash
lsof -ti :8787 | xargs kill -9
```

For Docker Compose deployments, stop the service with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Running authorised scans

```bash
vulnoraiq \
  --target demo \
  --profile baseline \
  --output reports/output/demo-report.md \
  --json-output reports/output/demo-report.json \
  --sarif-output reports/output/demo-report.sarif \
  --dashboard-output reports/output/demo-dashboard.md \
  --html-dashboard-output reports/output/demo-dashboard.html
```

Only use configured targets against systems you own or are explicitly authorised to assess:

```bash
vulnoraiq \
  --target owasp_lab_agent_http \
  --profile ai_testing_guide_foundation \
  --authorised
```

---

## Functional acceptance and release gates

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
pytest -q
python -m pip check
pip-audit
python scripts/validate_package_metadata.py
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py

## Roadmap

Post-completion hardening priorities:

- deeper OWASP/GenAI category logic and evaluator thresholds
- richer local and self-hosted benchmark targets
- provider/data inventory connectors for authorised GenAI assessments
- clearer target adapter templates for AI agents, LLM APIs, RAG systems, and local model servers
- packaged laptop/server installation paths
- optional OIDC/JWT validation for enterprise self-hosted deployments
- stronger single-server operations guidance for reverse proxy, TLS, backups, and audit logs
- independent penetration test of the Web UI and assessment engine
- report language maturity review for external assurance use
