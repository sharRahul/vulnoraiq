# VulnoraIQ

**VulnoraIQ** is a self-hosted AI security assessment application for authorised testing of **LLM applications, RAG pipelines, AI agents, tool-using systems, GenAI data flows, vector stores, providers, telemetry, reports, and orchestration layers**.

It is designed to run on a **laptop, workstation, lab machine, or internal server** so security teams can test AI agents and LLM applications they own or are explicitly authorised to assess.

VulnoraIQ helps teams collect evidence, score findings, generate reports, and track OWASP LLM / OWASP GenAI / Agentic / MITRE ATLAS coverage as the framework matures.

## Current status

**Version:** `0.2.0`  
**Deployment posture:** self-hosted laptop/server application with controlled internal production-readiness gate passed  
**Assessment assurance:** starter/framework evidence, not certified VAPT-grade assurance

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Local laptop / workstation demo | Supported |
| Self-hosted internal server deployment | Supported with production configuration validation |
| OWASP LLM coverage | Working starter |
| GenAI Security readiness | Working starter with safe synthetic `DSGAI01–DSGAI21` scenarios and CI validation |
| Agentic Applications readiness | Complete for controlled internal phase gates |
| Certified VAPT-grade security assurance | Not claimed |

> **Maturity warning:** VulnoraIQ is intended to run as a local or self-hosted internal application for authorised assessment work.

`0.2.0` may be described as:

> **Self-hosted laptop/server AI security testing application with controlled internal production-readiness gate passed.**

It must **not** be described as certified VAPT-grade assurance or a real-world VAPT replacement.

## Responsible-use boundary

Use VulnoraIQ only against systems you own or are explicitly authorised to assess.

The default `demo` target is safe and local. Configured non-demo targets require an explicit authorisation flag. Do not run assessments against third-party systems without written permission.

## Dashboard example

The dashboard below is generated from the safe local functional test path and shows the intended reporting workflow.

## What VulnoraIQ provides today

### Assessment framework

- Safe local demo target with no external API keys.
- Baseline, RAG, agent, and full assessment profiles.
- Configured target adapters for HTTP JSON, chat-completions-compatible APIs, Ollama-style generate APIs, and webhook JSON shapes.
- Explicit authorisation gate for non-demo targets.
- Scanner, scoring, result model, policy evaluation, scoped policy exceptions, and approval evidence validation.
- Markdown, JSON, SARIF-style, Markdown dashboard, HTML dashboard, diff, trend, benchmark, and branded HTML export outputs.

### OWASP / GenAI / Agentic / MITRE coverage

### Production hardening for self-hosted internal deployment

- Hosted Web UI with Server-Sent Events progress updates.
- Auth enabled by default and fail-closed.
- Environment-token auth and trusted reverse-proxy identity mode.
- Role-based access: viewer, analyst, admin.
- Production-mode startup validation.
- CSRF protection for state-changing scan requests.
- Request-size limits, malformed JSON handling, and structured API errors.
- Per-IP rate limiting and scan concurrency/queue limits.
- Security headers on normal and error responses.
- Trusted proxy CIDR checks for forwarded IP and identity headers.
- SQLite job persistence by default with WAL mode, foreign keys, busy timeout, and schema versioning.
- Structured JSON audit logs with request correlation IDs.
- Auth-protected Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint by default.
- Artifact path protection and role-aware config endpoint output.
- SQLite backup/restore scripts with validation, compression, and retention support.
- Non-root Dockerfile, `/data` volume, healthcheck, Docker Compose, and `.env.production.example`.
- CI gates for Ruff, mypy, pytest, `pip check`, `pip-audit`, package metadata validation, OWASP/ATLAS mapping validation, GenAI readiness validation, production-readiness validation, and functional acceptance.

## Quick start: local demo

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]

vulnoraiq --target demo --profile baseline
```

The demo target uses an in-memory echo client and does not call external services.

---

## Web UI: self-hosted startup

Production mode fails closed if required controls are missing or unsafe.

```bash
export VULNORAIQ_ENV=production
export VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true
export VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_BACKEND=sqlite
export VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_PATH=/data/jobs.db
export VULNORAIQ_WEB_OUTPUT_ROOT=/data/reports

python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

### Stopping the Web UI server

If the Web UI is running in the foreground, stop it with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `vulnoraiq-web` is running.

If it was started in the background, find the process that is listening on port `8787` and terminate it:

```bash
lsof -ti :8787 | xargs kill
```

Use a forced kill only if the process does not stop cleanly:

```bash
lsof -ti :8787 | xargs kill -9
```

For Docker Compose deployments, stop the service with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Running authorised scans

```bash
vulnoraiq \
  --target demo \
  --profile baseline \
  --output reports/output/demo-report.md \
  --json-output reports/output/demo-report.json \
  --sarif-output reports/output/demo-report.sarif \
  --dashboard-output reports/output/demo-dashboard.md \
  --html-dashboard-output reports/output/demo-dashboard.html
```

Only use configured targets against systems you own or are explicitly authorised to assess:

```bash
vulnoraiq \
  --target custom_http_agent \
  --profile baseline \
  --authorised
```

---

## Functional acceptance and release gates

```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
pytest -q
python -m pip check
pip-audit
python scripts/validate_package_metadata.py
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py \
  --run-functional \
  --output-dir reports/output/production-readiness
```

If Docker is available:

```bash
docker build -t vulnoraiq:0.2.0-rc .
python scripts/container_smoke_test.py
```

## Roadmap

Next engineering priorities:

- deeper OWASP/GenAI category logic and evaluator thresholds
- richer local and self-hosted benchmark targets
- provider/data inventory connectors for authorised GenAI assessments
- clearer target adapter templates for AI agents, LLM APIs, RAG systems, and local model servers
- packaged laptop/server installation paths
- optional OIDC/JWT validation for enterprise self-hosted deployments
- stronger single-server operations guidance for reverse proxy, TLS, backups, and audit logs
- independent penetration test of the Web UI and assessment engine
- report language maturity review for external assurance use
