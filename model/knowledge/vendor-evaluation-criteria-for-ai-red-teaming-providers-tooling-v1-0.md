1. Executive Summary

Most organizations deploy simple GenAI systems, such as chatbots, customer-support assistants, workflow
copilots, and basic RAG applications. A smaller but growing number operate advanced AI systems such as
tool-calling agents, MCP-based architectures, and multi-agent workflows.
Both categories introduce risks that require specialized adversarial evaluation. Many vendors overclaim,
focusing on superficial jailbreak demonstrations or static prompt libraries while ignoring systemic
vulnerabilities, workflow bypasses, misuse risks, and failures in agentic or tool-enabled systems.
This document provides criteria for evaluating vendors of AI Red Teaming consulting services as well as
automated tooling, and includes considerations for both simple and advanced GenAI deployments. It
highlights:
•
What effective AI red teaming looks like
•
What questions to ask vendors
•
What “green flags” indicate competence
•
What “red flags” signal low-quality or misleading offerings
•
How to distinguish genuine adversarial evaluation from superficial testing
The goal is to enable business leaders and executives to confidently identify providers who reduce real risk,
not those who merely offer the illusion of coverage.

2. Background and Definitions

## 2.1 What AI Red Teaming Is (and is not)
For the purpose of this document, AI Red Teaming is defined as the adversarial testing of AI systems to
uncover safety, security, misuse, robustness, ethical, and alignment failure modes. It includes both single-
turn and multi-turn probing, workflow abuse, systemic bypasses, and scenario-based misuse discovery.
This document does not address vendors who use AI to perform traditional red teaming of infrastructure,
networks, web apps, or social engineering. It is strictly focused on vendors providing services to perform red
teaming of AI models and AI systems.

## 2.2 System Types Covered in This Document
Simple GenAI Systems
While the landscape is rapidly evolving, these simple systems are most commonly deployed today. Simple
system include:
•
Customer support chatbots
•
Internal LLM copilots (HR, IT, finance, sales)
•
Workflow assistants
•
FAQ/knowledge-base bots
•
RAG systems and retrieval-based question answering
•
Task-specific single-turn or multi-turn conversational agents
•
Chat or agents with reasoning capability, based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Typical risks include jailbreaks, harmful content, hallucinations, leakage, misuse of internal data,
inconsistent behavior, and persona manipulation.
Advanced GenAI Systems
Increasingly common in enterprise-grade solutions and rapidly scaling, advanced system include:
•

CosmoDB) and/or vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
•
Observability and Monitoring integrations (Datadog, Langfuse, MLFlow)
•
LLM-integrated automation for real operations
Typical risks include unsafe tool execution, rug pull attacks, tool shadowing, capability escalation, inter-
agent contamination, message-passing vulnerabilities, memory and context poisoning, data exposure, data
poisoning, data exfiltration, output control to social engineer the users, control reasoning and emergent
behavior failures.

## 2.3 Typical Targets
•
Foundation models (text, multimodal)
•
Fine-tuned enterprise models (domain-adapted, instruction-tuned, RLHF-trained)
•
Chatbots and domain copilots
•
RAG systems and retrieval chains
•
Databases made available for the agents and/or where chat logs are stored
•
Agentic systems: single-agent, multi-agent, role-based orchestrators
•
MCP-based tool registries
•
Tool-calling workflows
•
LLM-enabled autonomous workflows

<!-- page 10 -->
genai.owasp.org
## 2.4 Vendor Types

Vendor Type
Description
Chatbot / Basic LLM Red
Teaming Specialists
These vendors typically test simpler LLM applications for issues like
jailbreak detection, safety issues, hallucination stress testing, and
domain-specific misuse. They focus on the model/app-layer
interaction rather than complex system behavior.
AI Red Team Consultants
Human adversaries skilled in complex, multi-step discovery, threat
modeling, emergent behavior analysis, and deep architectural testing.
They are well suited for testing advanced AI systems or high-stakes
deployments, requiring novel attack discovery, complex multi-agent
system analysis, and custom threat modeling.
Automated AI Red Teaming
Tools
These tools enable large suites of adversarial tests at scale, running
prompt libraries, scenario variations, agent/tool-call workflows, and
MCP testing. Often these target CI/CD pipelines with the goal of
achieving 24/7 continuous testing and mapping performance over time.

genai.owasp.org
## 3.5 Evaluation Rigor & Metrics
Evaluation must focus on clarity, consistency, reproducibility, and severity assessment tied to real-world
risk. Vendors must prioritize established metrics and transparent benchmarks over their own opaque,
proprietary methodologies. Context is critical to interpret results, since certain domains may be less
tolerant to error (e.g. when it involves medical data).
For Simple Systems
Performance metrics require a consistent definition rooted in research, not marketing, to connect technical
failures such as hallucinations to business risks. Metrics must account for multiple attempts of the same
attack, prompt chaining, and chain-of-thought, rather than relying on single-shot results. In RAG systems,
metrics must be grounded on the information retrieval mechanisms. Expect metrics on:

•
They work with you to define risk tolerance thresholds specific to the domain.
•
Vendor separates technical failures from policy violations.
•
Vendor reports state-of-the-art metrics which addresses the complexity of GenAI systems, e.g.:
o
pass@k: Measures the probability of an attack succeeding given k independent attempts.
o
Average Turns to Jailbreak: Tracks how deep a system withstands before breaking.

<!-- page 17 -->
genai.owasp.org
o
Average Risk Density: Average of the ratio of harmful tokens to all reasoning tokens, in the
cases where chain-of-thought content is exposed to the attacker.
o
Retrieval Success Rate (RSR@k): Measures how frequently injected malicious content in
RAG is successfully retrieved via semantic search and re-ranking.
For Advanced Systems

manipulated into executing "Admin" level tool calls.
•
Vendor tests multi-step tool abuse chains (e.g., Step 1: Use search_wiki to find a CEO's bio. Step 2:
Use draft_email to impersonate them. Step 3: Use send_invoice to steal funds).

How do you test permission boundaries and privilege separation between agents and their assigned
tools or capabilities?

6. Common Pitfalls in Vendor
Evaluation

The following common errors must be avoided to ensure a successful vendor selection:
•
Assuming simple systems are safe: While they may lack tools or agents, there is significant risk
present even with simple systems.
•
Confusing jailbreaks with systemic red teaming: Jailbreaks are a small subset of the risks
presented by agentic and tool-using systems. For instance, a system might be robust against
jailbreaks but still vulnerable to Denial of Wallet (DoW) attacks.
•
Overweighting polished demos: Demand evidence (logs, traces, reproducibility) over
demonstration of simple, known attacks.
•
Treating modern architectures as chatbots: Believing that MCP, tool-calling, or multi-agent
systems are merely extensions of single-turn LLMs is a systemic failure.
•
Believing automation replaces experienced adversaries: Automation scales; human consultants
provide novelty and complex, context-specific creativity.
•
Trusting metrics that don't account for emergent behavior: Metrics must explicitly quantify inter-
agent contamination and goal escalation.
•
Assuming reproducibility without verifying it: For complex multi-agent or tool-use failures,
demand deterministic replay capabilities.
•
Assuming tool calls and MCP output is inherently safe:  Ignore risks like unsafe tool execution,
capability escalation, and privilege escalation pathways through tools and agents.
•
Over-valuing bespoke claims: Vendors claim "we will build it" as a strength, however it often signals
a lack of a scaled, enterprise-ready methodology and leads to expensive, unproven, bespoke test
suites.

7. Vendor Evaluation Checklist

This checklist can be used to score potential vendors.

Criteria
Category
AI Red Team Consultant
Requirement
Automated Tool
Requirement
Technical Competence
Demonstrated deep knowledge of
MCP, Tool-Calling, and Multi-Agent
risks.
Tool supports introspection of
modern architectures.
Methodology & Coverage
Covers complex and adaptive
attack chains across all
components.
Automation tests go beyond canned
jailbreak libraries.
Adversarial Creativity
Ability to craft novel, domain-
specific adversarial strategies.
High diversity and adaptiveness in
attack generation.
Threat Modeling
Extends beyond jailbreaks to
systemic failures (e.g., resource
abuse via tools).
Supports custom threat model
mapping to automated tests.
Evaluation Rigor & Metrics
Human-verified scoring; severity
tied to real-world risk.
Provides clear, objective metrics for
tool-call robustness/MCP misuse.
Tooling & Infrastructure
Safe access control and logging for
sensitive interactions.
Supports in-environment testing and
deterministic replay of sequences.
Data Governance &
Security
Clear policies for handling
sensitive logs/prompts/outputs.
Option for on-prem or self-hosting,
protecting MCP tool-access data.
Transparency &
Explainability
Provides full message and action
traces and tool-call provenance.
Outputs detailed logs for every step of
a multi-turn/multi-agent test.

<!-- page 29 -->
genai.owasp.org
Customization &
Adaptability
Adaptable to custom agent
workflows and bespoke tooling.
Supports definition of custom attack
flows and policies.
Operational Fit /
Integration
Clear plan for CI/CD or integration
into dev workflows.
API supports automated regression
testing of mitigations.
Known Limitations &
Biases
Transparent about scope and blind
spots (e.g., emergent behavior).
Doesn't overclaim or rely on “coverage
illusion.”
Cost vs. Value
Pricing model is clear and ROI
focuses on risk reduction.
Transparent pricing for ongoing
retesting and scaling.
Legal, Ethical, Compliance
Aligns with NIST AI RMF, OWASP,
and safe testing norms.
Clear data handling and chain-of-
custody protocols.
Agentic Action Space
Must test for unauthorized state
changes (e.g., database writes),
confused deputy attacks, and
privilege escalation via tools.
Must support "mock" or "dry-run"
execution modes to safely test
destructive tool calls without
impacting production.
Planning & Reasoning
Logic
Capability to manually test for goal
hijacking, infinite loops, and error
handling abuse (forcing agents into
unsafe fallback modes).
Automated probes for infinite loop
detection, resource exhaustion (DoS)
limits, and token budget enforcement.
Indirect Injection (Trojan
Horse)
Must simulate "poisoned context"
attacks (e.g., malicious
PDFs/Emails in RAG) to silently
rewire agent instructions.
Capability to inject payloads into RAG
pipelines or mock document retrieval
systems to test retrieval defenses.
