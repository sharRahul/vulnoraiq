1. Introduction

This guide aims to provide practical and actionable guidance for designing, developing, and deploying secure
agentic applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It complements the OWASP Agentic AI
Threats and Mitigations (ASI T&M) document by focusing on concrete technical recommendations that
builders and defenders can apply directly.
## 1.1 Scope and Audience
Audience: This guide is primarily intended for software developers, AI/ML engineers, security architects,
security engineers, and technical leads involved in building, securing, or assessing workflow and agentic AI
applications.
In Scope:
•
Technical security controls and best practices for agentic systems.
•
Secure architectural patterns specific to agentic AI.
•
Mitigation strategies for common agentic threats.
•
Guidance across the development lifecycle (design, build, deploy, operate).
•
Considerations for key components like LLMs, orchestration, memory, tools, and operational
environments.
•
Examples of applying security principles in different agentic architectures (single-agent, multi-
agent, etc.).
Out of Scope:
•
High-level governance frameworks, organizational policies, or CISO-level strategic guidance (These
will be addressed in a separate "Managing Agentic Risk Guide").
•
Detailed implementation guides for specific vendor platforms or frameworks (though examples may
be used illustratively).
•
Ethical considerations beyond their direct impact on security implementation (e.g., bias mitigation
strategies unrelated to security vulnerabilities).
•
Legal and compliance requirements specific to jurisdictions or industries, although the principles
discussed support compliance efforts.
•
The document does not cover governance and CISO-related guidelines, which will be covered in
subsequent guidelines.

## 1.3 Relationship with other ASI work
This document is part of the broader OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) and is designed to work along
with other ASI resources. Specifically:
•
ASI Threats & Mitigations (T&M): This guide provides practical implementation details and
architectural context for the mitigations proposed in the T&M document. Where the T&M list
identifies what threats exist and what mitigations are needed, this guide focuses on how to
implement those mitigations technically. We reference the T-codes (e.g., T1, T2) from the T&M list
throughout this document.
•
ASI Red Teaming Guide: This guide provides the builder and defender perspective, outlining
controls that red teams (following the Red Teaming Guide) would test. Understanding the defenses
detailed here is crucial for effective red teaming simulation design.
Essentially, this guide translates the conceptual threats and mitigation principles from other ASI work into
actionable architectural patterns and developer guidelines.

2. Secure Agentic
Architectures
## 2.1 Defining Key Components of Agentic Architectures
KC1 Generative Language Models: The "brain" (Cognitive engine) of the agent (e.g., GPT-4, Claude),
responsible for understanding, reasoning, planning, and generating responses. LLMs are often built on pre-
trained foundation models, which provide broad knowledge and can be specialized using techniques like
prompt engineering or fine-tuning.
●
KC1.1 Large Language Models (LLMs): The core cognitive engine ("brain") utilizing pre-trained
foundation models (e.g., GPT series, Claude series, Llama series, Gemini series) for reasoning,
planning, and generation, primarily directed via prompt engineering and operating within
constraints like context window, latency, and cost.
●
KC1.2 Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs): LLMs capable of processing and/or generating information across
multiple data types beyond text (e.g., images, audio), enabling agents to perform a wider variety of
tasks involving visual or auditory information (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini).
●
KC1.3 Small-Language Model (SLMs): Language models with fewer parameters, which are trained
on much smaller, more focused datasets. SLMs are generally designed to perform a specific task or

<!-- page 7 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
work in a particular use case, rather than wielding the large, generalized capabilities found in an
LLM. SLMs are characterized by a smaller weight space, parameter size, and context window when
compared with LLMs.
●
KC1.4 Fine-tuned Models: Language models (LLMs / MLLMs) that undergo additional training on
specific datasets to specialize their capabilities, enhancing performance, adopting personas, or
improving reliability for particular tasks, domains, or interaction styles required by the agent. For
example, Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Circuit Breakers (CB) have been found to bring promising
scoping benefits to reduce the propensity to provide answers to out-of-scope topics.
KC2 Orchestration (Control Flow Mechanisms): Dictate the agent's overall behavior, information flow, and
decision-making processes. The specific mechanism (e.g., “sequential” for layered architectures, “dynamic”
for blackboard architectures, or “coordinated” for multi-agent systems) depends on the architecture and
impacts the agent's responsiveness and efficiency.
●
KC2.1 Workflows: A structured, pre-defined sequence of tasks or steps that agents follow to
achieve a goal. Workflows define the flow of information and actions within the agent's operation
and among agents. They can be linear, conditional, or iterative, depending on the task’s complexity.
●
KC2.2 Hierarchical Planning: Multiple agents collaborating via an orchestrator (router). The
orchestrator plays a central role in this process. It is responsible for:
○
Understanding the Task: The orchestrator receives the initial complex task or request.
○
Decomposing the Task: The orchestrator then analyzes the task and breaks it down into a
series of sub-tasks.
○
Routing to Specialized Agents: The orchestrator identifies which specialized agent is best
suited to handle each sub-task and assigns the sub-task accordingly.
○
Orchestrator monitors agent performance, identifies inefficiencies, and autonomously
adjusts workflows to optimize efficiency.
○
The Orchestrator can interface with the user directly or with a “master” agent that helps
coordinate the various agents.
●
KC2.3 Multi-agent Collaboration: This involves multiple agents working together to achieve a
common goal. Agents can communicate and coordinate their actions, sharing information and
resources. This approach is useful for complex tasks that require diverse skills or knowledge. For
example, one agent might be responsible for data collection, while another is responsible for
analysis, and a third is responsible for decision-making.

<!-- page 8 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
KC3 Reasoning / Planning Paradigm: Agents utilize LLMs to solve complex tasks requiring multiple steps
using strategic thinking. To do so, agents break down high-level tasks into smaller tasks (steps), each with a
different sub-goal.
Enable AI agents to solve complex problems requiring multiple steps and logical thinking.
●
KC3.1 Structured Planning / Execution (e.g., ReWoo, LLM Compiler, Plan-and-Execute), focuses on:
○
Decomposing tasks into a formal plan.
○
Defining sequences of actions, often involving specific tool calls.
○
Executing the plan, sometimes using separate "planner" and "executor" components.
●
KC3.2 ReAct (Reason + Act): Dynamically interleaves reasoning steps with actions (like using tools
or querying APIs) and updates reasoning based on feedback.
●
KC3.3 Chain of Thought (CoT): Enhances reasoning quality by prompting step-by-step "thinking",
inducing an LLM to generate a set of “thoughts” before arriving and a final action or conclusion.
●
KC3.4 Tree of Thoughts (ToT): Generalizes CoT by exploring multiple reasoning paths and plans in
parallel with lookahead, backtracking, and self-evaluation.
KC4 Memory Modules: Enable the agent to retain short-term (immediate context) and long-term
information (past interactions, knowledge) for coherent and personalized interactions. Context “sensitivity”
(classification or compartmentalization) is used to reduce the risk of unauthorized information exposure.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) used with a vector database is common for long-term memory,
allowing agents to retrieve and incorporate external knowledge using semantic search.
●
KC4.1 In agent session memory: Memory is limited to a single agent and a single session, limiting
the ability to compromise additional agents/sessions if compromised.
●
KC4.2 Cross-agent session memory: Memory is shared across multiple agents, but is limited to a
single session, limiting the ability to compromise additional sessions, but a single compromised
agent might compromise multiple agents operating at the same session.
●
KC4.3 In agent cross-session memory: Memory is limited to a single agent, but is shared across
multiple sessions, limiting the ability to compromise additional agents, but one compromised
session might still cause compromising multiple sessions.

<!-- page 9 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
KC4.4 Cross-agent cross-session memory: Memory is shared across multiple agents and sessions.
If an agent is compromised in a specific session, it might compromise additional sessions and or
agents.
●
KC4.5 In agent cross-user memory: Memory is limited to a single agent but is shared across
multiple users. A compromised agent might have the ability to compromise multiple users.
●
KC4.6 Cross-agent cross-user: Memory is shared across multiple agents and users. A
compromised agent might have the ability to compromise additional agents and users.
KC5 Tool Integration Frameworks: Allow agents to extend their capabilities beyond text by using external
tools (APIs, functions, data stores) to interact with the real world or other systems. Tool integration
framework is used to manage the selection and use of these tools.  These frameworks offer various "Agent"
types, for example ReAct, Self-Ask, and OpenAI Functions Agent.
●
KC5.1 Flexible Libraries / SDK Features: These provide code-level building blocks (e.g.,  LangChain,
AG2, Agents, CrewAI, MCP ) or specific API capabilities (like OpenAI's Tool Use feature) for
developers. They offer high flexibility and control over agent behavior and tool orchestration, but
require more coding effort and technical expertise to implement and manage the full agent loop.
●
KC5.2 Managed Platforms / Services: These are vendor-provided solutions (like Amazon Bedrock
Agents, Microsoft Copilot Platform) that handle infrastructure, simplify setup, and manage much of
the orchestration for building agents with tools. They often feature easier integration within the
provider's ecosystem and may include low-code interfaces, trading some flexibility for faster
development and deployment.
●
KC5.3 Managed APIs: Similar to managed platforms but often emphasizing the API as the main
interaction point, these are vendor-hosted services (like OpenAI's Assistants API) providing higher-
level abstractions. They manage complexities like state and aspects of tool orchestration via API
calls, making it easier to build sophisticated, stateful agents compared to using basic SDK features
alone.
KC6 Operational Environment  (Agencies): Though Large Language Models (LLMs) are restricted to the data
available up to their last training update, agents can interface with external environments through tools and
function calls. Utilizing different agencies enables interaction with, gather, and process information from
external environments, allowing them to operate effectively within them.
●
KC6.1 API Access :
○
KC6.1.1 Limited API Access: An agent utilizing LLM capabilities to generate some of the
parameters to a predefined API call (e.g., an agent utilizing LLM to generate a parameter

<!-- page 10 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
used in a predefined REST/GraphQL API call). A compromised agent might have the ability to
launch attacks on the API (see OWASP Top 10 for API), via the parameters generated by the
LLM, resulting in a parameter pollution attack.
○
KC6.1.2 Extensive API Access: An agent utilizing LLM capabilities to generate the entire
API call (e.g., an agent utilizing LLM to interactively traverse a GraphQL API or to generate
the entire URL to a REST API). A compromised agent might have the ability to generate
unwanted API calls on behalf of the user by utilizing the agent's excessive authorization, and
to launch attacks on the API (see OWASP Top 10 for API).
●
KC6.2 Code Execution:
○
KC6.2.1 Limited Code Execution Capability: An agent utilizing LLM capabilities to generate
some of the parameters to a predefined function (e.g., an agent utilizing LLM to generate a
parameter used in a predefined Python/PHP/JS function). A compromised agent might
have the ability to launch code injection attacks (see OWASP code injection), via the
parameters generated by the LLM.
○
KC6.2.2 Extensive Code Execution Capability: An agent running code generated by an LLM.
A compromised agent might have the ability to run arbitrary code
●
KC6.3 Database Execution:
○
KC6.3.1 Limited Database Execution Capability: An agent utilizing LLM capabilities to run
specific queries or commands against a database. Limited database execution is
characterized by an agent having a limited permission set, such as read-only permissions at
the table or row level, and/or constructing write with access to only change certain
parameters, using parameterization or pre-constructed queries. A compromised agent
could exfiltrate a table from a database or write malformed/malicious data to a limited
space in a database/table.
○
KC6.3.2 Extensive Database Execution Capability: An agent utilizing LLM capabilities to
generate and run all CRUD operations against a set of tables or complete database. A
compromised agent might have the ability to alter any record in the database, delete a
database/table, or access and leak any information stored within the database.
○
KC6.3.3 Agent Memory or Context Data Sources (e.g., RAG agent): An agent utilizing an
external data source to gain contextual information, or updates records in external sources
based on user inputs. A compromised agent might disrupt data in the data source or provide
malformed information retrieved from the data source.

<!-- page 11 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
KC6.4 Web Access Capabilities (web-use):  An agent utilizing LLM for operating with the browser
(e.g., OpenAI operator, browser-use). A compromised agent is likely to form due to exposure to
untrusted web content, and it might perform unwanted operations on behalf of the user by utilizing
the agent’s excessive authorization (e.g., changing sharing settings or account settings on open
user sessions).
●
KC6.5 Controlling PC Operations (PC-use): An agent utilizing LLM for operating with the operating
system, including file system (e.g., Anthropic computer use). A compromised agent might perform
unwanted operations, expose or leak personal information, and perform malicious operations such
as encrypting files.
●
KC6.6 Operating Critical Systems (e.g., SCADA): An agent using LLM to operate critical systems.
Unauthorized operations in critical systems can lead to catastrophic failures. A compromised agent
may cause severe disruptions in system operations.
●
KC6.7 Access to IoT Devices: Unauthorized control over IoT devices. A compromised agent could
impact the operational environment hosting such IoT devices, potentially utilizing them in malicious
or unintended ways (eg, drastically changing room temperature using an IoT-connected
thermostat).

## 2.2 Secure Architecture Patterns
Building secure agentic systems requires more than just securing individual components; it demands a
holistic approach where security is embedded within the architecture itself. The choice of architecture (e.g.,
sequential, hierarchical, swarm) significantly influences the attack surface and the effectiveness of
different security controls. This section details fundamental security patterns applicable across various
architectures and then explores how specific architectural choices impact the implementation of defenses
like isolation, least privilege, and secure communication. By understanding these patterns and practices,
architects and developers can design systems that are resilient to agentic-specific threats from the ground
up.

<!-- page 15 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
2.2.1. Core patterns being used in all frameworks
While the landscape of agentic frameworks (Like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, etc.) is diverse, several
fundamental architectural patterns appear consistently. These patterns represent common solutions to
core challenges in agent development, which include extending capabilities, improving reasoning, and
enabling self-correction.
Understanding these core patterns is crucial for security, as they often introduce specific control points and
potential vulnerabilities regardless of the overarching framework used. The following patterns are frequently
employed building blocks within larger agentic systems:
Tool Use Pattern:
○
Concept: Equips agents with the ability to use external tools, APIs, or functions to extend
their capabilities beyond internal knowledge or LLM reasoning. The agent delegates tasks
such as data retrieval, calculations, or actions to the appropriate tools.
○
Key Components: Requires tool definitions, an agent reasoning loop capable of selecting
and invoking tools, and integration mechanisms.
The following diagram illustrates interactions in the Tool Use pattern.

<!-- page 16 -->
genai.owasp.org
-

Figure 1 - Tool Use Pattern Interactions
Reflection Pattern:4
○
Concept: Enables agents to introspect, evaluate their past actions, decisions, or outputs
against goals or metrics, and use this self-assessment to refine future strategies or correct
errors.
○
Key Components: Involves feedback loops, evaluation logic, and mechanisms for the agent
to modify its behavior or knowledge.

<!-- page 17 -->
genai.owasp.org
-

Figure 2 - Reflection Pattern
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern:
○
Concept: Enhances LLM-based agents by first retrieving relevant information from an
external knowledge base (vector store, database, etc.) based on the user query, and then
providing this retrieved context to the LLM along with the original query to generate a more
informed and accurate response.
○
Key Components: Requires a retriever module, a knowledge base/vector store, and
integration with the LLM prompt.

<!-- page 18 -->
genai.owasp.org
-

Figure 3 - RAG Pattern
User privilege/auth assumption pattern for execution
We consider two user privilege and authentication patterns:
●
Direct Model Interaction with a system via an API and other entities: When an agent is executing
against an API, database, or entity that has a concept of granular user permissions, it should assume
the permission of the user who invoked the agent. This will enforce the granular security controls on
the agent, preventing it from returning information the user shouldn’t have access to, such as other
user data or data that is not relevant to the current action. This may also be used in the Just-In-Time
access and ephemeral access use cases.

<!-- page 19 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Additionally, if the user privileges are not already restricted by a strong “Chinese Wall” model (to
prevent information in records from leaking to unrelated records), the agent should track the
boundary of the context it is operating on.
●
Key components: LLM brain (KC1), Execution system for an API (KC6.1, KC6.3, KC6.4), and an
authentication/authorization/IAM system.

Figure 4 - User Assumption in Direct Model Interaction

User Interaction: When an AI agent is executing tasks that require interaction with a user's browser or
computer, and these tasks demand authentication, the agent should either prompt the user for credentials
out-of-band or securely integrate with a trusted password manager. This will prevent the agent from storing
or exposing sensitive credentials and ensure that the actions taken by the agent are authorized by the user.

<!-- page 20 -->
genai.owasp.org

Figure 5 - Direct User Interaction

2.2.2. Sequential Agent Architecture
A straightforward linear workflow where a single agent processes input through planning, execution, and
basic tool use. This pattern focuses on simplicity with a clear chain of thought and limited memory. This
basic pattern uses a single LLM as the cognitive core with a linear workflow:
●
Brain: Single LLM (KC1.1)
●
Control: Simple sequential workflow (KC2.1)
●
Reasoning: Chain of Thought reasoning (KC3.3)
●
Memory: In-agent session memory only (KC4.1)

<!-- page 21 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Tools: Limited SDK integration (KC5.1)
●
Environment: Restricted API access (KC6.1.1)

Figure 6 - Sequential Agent Architecture
## 2.2.3 Hierarchical Agent Architecture/ Role-Based Multi-Agent Systems
An orchestrator agent breaks down complex tasks and distributes them to specialized sub-agents. Each
agent handles a specific domain using appropriate tools, with the orchestrator managing the overall process
and integrating results. A more complex pattern with specialized sub-agents coordinated by an
orchestrator:
●
Brain: Multiple specialized LLMs / fine-tuned models (KC1.1 / KC1.2)
●
Control: Hierarchical planning with orchestrator (KC2.2)
●
Reasoning: Structured planning/execution (KC3.1)

<!-- page 22 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Memory: Cross-agent session memory (KC4.2)
●
Tools: Managed platforms/services (KC5.2)
●
Environment: More extensive capabilities (KC6.2, KC6.4)

Figure 7 - Hierarchical Agent Architecture

2.2.4. Collaborative Agent Swarm/Distributed Agent Mesh
A pattern where multiple peer agents work together without a strict hierarchy:
●
Brain: Multiple specialized agents (KC1.1 / KC1.2)

<!-- page 23 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Control: Multi-agent collaboration (KC2.3)
●
Reasoning: Tree of Thoughts for exploring multiple solutions (KC3.4)
●
Memory: Cross-agent cross-session memory (KC4.4)
●
Tools: Flexible libraries with collaboration features (KC5.1)
●
Environment: Distributed operational capabilities (various KC6)

Figure 8 - Collaborative Agent Swarm/Distributed Agent Mesh
These patterns can be mixed and matched based on specific application requirements, with security
considerations becoming increasingly important as the agent's operational capabilities expand.

## 2.3 Frameworks
Numerous frameworks and libraries have emerged to accelerate the development of agentic applications.
These frameworks provide pre-built components, abstractions, and patterns (Like those discussed in 2.2.1)
to handle common tasks such as managing state, integrating tools, orchestrating workflows, and interacting
with LLMs.
However, the choice of framework can have significant security implications, influencing the default
security posture, the ease of implementing controls, and the potential attack surface. Some frameworks are
general-purpose, while others are specialized for specific tasks like multi-agent collaboration or data-
intensive RAG. This section provides an overview of some popular frameworks, categorized by their primary
focus.
2.3.1. General-Purpose Agent Frameworks
Caution: Customization and abstraction are a trade-off. Frameworks are great for proof of concept, but
when implemented in production create more dependencies. If you modify a framework to fit your unique
needs, then later that framework is patched due to a vulnerability being discovered, you’re left needing a
rapid update that could have significant impacts on your system because your customer code no longer fits
the updated core. There is fragility in those types of situations that should be considered by the development
team.

<!-- page 28 -->
genai.owasp.org
-

Figure 9 - Multi-agent copilot application architecture
It specifically implements KC2.2 Hierarchical Planning to access various enterprise APIs such as calendar,
email, Drive, and Slack. The system is composed of the following collaborating agents:
●
Orchestrator Agent:
○
Role: Acts as the central controller within the hierarchical structure. It receives user
requests, utilizes its tools to decompose them into sub-tasks (KC3.1 Structured
Planning/Execution principles), and delegates these tasks to specialized agents (Calendar,
Email, Slack, Drive) via its Agent Routing Mechanism. It then aggregates the responses from
these agents using its Response Aggregator tool to present a unified output to the user.
○
Core Intelligence: Leverages KC1.1 Large Language Models (LLMs) within its specialized
tools.
○
Tool Integration: Likely utilizes KC5.1 Flexible Libraries / SDK Features for API integration.

<!-- page 29 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
■
Task Decomposition: An LLM-based tool for understanding user requests and
breaking them into smaller, actionable sub-tasks suitable for specialized agents.
■
Agent Routing Mechanism: An LLM-based tool for directing sub-tasks to the
appropriate specialized agent based on the task's nature.
■
Response Aggregator: An LLM-based tool for collecting, formatting, and
synthesizing responses from specialized agents into a coherent output.
○
Memory Access: Utilizes KC4.2 Cross-agent session memory. This memory is shared
among the Orchestrator and the specialized agents within the context of a single user
session. It stores user requests, intermediate reasoning data, and responses from
specialized agents and serves as the primary mechanism for communication between
agents during that session. Context “sensitivity” (classification or compartmentalization) is
used to reduce the risk of unauthorized information exposure.
●
Calendar Agent:
○
Role: Responsible for managing the user's calendar (scheduling, availability checks,
reminders).
○
Operational Environment (Agency Type): Operates under KC6.1.1 Limited API Access,
interacting with the user's calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar) via its specific API. This
involves predefined API calls where the agent's LLM might generate some parameters,
requiring authentication and authorization.
○
Specialized Tools:
■
Date and Time Parsing: Component to process date/time information.
■
Meeting Scheduling Logic: Rules/algorithms for scheduling tasks.
■
Reminder System: Mechanism for event reminders.
●
Email Agent:
○
Role: Manages the user's email (sending, receiving, organizing).
○
Operational Environment (Agency Type): Operates under KC6.1.1 Limited API Access,
interacting with the user's email service (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) via its API, requiring
authentication/authorization.
○
Specialized Tools:
■
Email API Integration: Access module.
■
Email Composition and Sending: Module for creating/sending emails.
■
Email Reading and Parsing: Component for processing received emails.
■
Email Filtering and Organization: Logic for email management.
●
Slack Agent:
○
Role: Facilitates communication and collaboration within Slack.

<!-- page 30 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Operational Environment (Agency Type): Operates under KC6.1.1 Limited API Access,
interacting with the Slack API, requiring authentication/authorization.
○
Specialized Tools:
■
Slack API Integration: Access module.
■
Message Sending and Retrieval: Module for Slack messages.
■
Channel Management: Logic for channel interactions.
■
Notification Handling: Mechanism for Slack notifications.
●
Drive Agent:
Role: Manages files and documents in the user's cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive).
○
Operational Environment (Agency Type): Operates under KC6.1.1 Limited API Access,
interacting with the cloud storage service's API, requiring authentication/authorization.
○
Specialized Tools:
■
Drive API Integration: Access module.
■
File Retrieval and Upload: Module for file operations.
■
File Searching and Filtering: Logic for finding files.
■
File Sharing and Permissions: Mechanism for managing access.

Applicable Threats:
●
Tool Misuse (T2) via KC6.1.1 Limited API Access: Even with predefined API calls, agents' KC1.1 LLMs
generate parameters. An attacker crafting deceptive prompts could cause the LLM to generate
malicious parameters, potentially leading to API vulnerabilities like parameter pollution attacks or
unauthorized operations within the API's allowed scope.
●
Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation (T6) impacting KC1.1 LLM within KC6.1.1: Attackers can inject
prompts attempting to manipulate the agent's underlying KC1.1 LLM. The goal is to steer the agent
towards generating parameters that achieve a malicious goal, even within the constraints imposed
by the KC6.1.1 Limited API Access.
Identity Spoofing & Impersonation (T9) related to KC6.1.1 parameters: If the parameters generated by the
agent's KC1.1 LLM for the KC6.1.1 Limited API Access calls include user identifiers or potentially manipulable
tokens, an attacker might try to alter these parameters via prompt injection to impersonate another

3. Agentic Developer
Guidelines
Agentic AI Developer Security Guidelines: A Lifecycle
Approach
Building secure Agentic AI systems requires integrating security considerations throughout the entire
development lifecycle, from initial design to ongoing operations. Security is not an afterthought; it is a
foundational principle necessary regardless of the agent's architecture (single, multi-agent, swarm),
complexity, or function. Proactive security measures create a resilient framework against evolving threats
specific to AI systems, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, and data poisoning. This guide
outlines practical security controls across the typical development phases. Consider referencing
frameworks like the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications for common vulnerabilities.
3.1. Secure Design & Development Phase
Agentic AI systems require more than mitigations to core security risks of LLMs (as presented in the LLM top
10), as they introduce fundamentally new security surfaces. Persistent memory raises the risk of context
poisoning, data leakage, and unauthorized state retention. Autonomous planning opens the door to
misaligned objectives, recursive decision loops, and unpredictable emergent behavior. These risks must be
accounted for at design time, not just through traditional and LLM threat modeling, but through new
considerations like defining “safe failure” states (see also “Taxonomy of Failure Modes in AI Agents”), charting
integration boundaries, specifying memory access policies, and ensuring human-in-the-loop safeguards
where applicable. These early decisions shape downstream control strategies and lay the foundation for
resilient agentic systems.
3.1.1. Threat Modeling for Agentic Systems:
For details on the threat model for agentic systems, please see the latest version of:
https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/
3.1.2. System Prompt Engineering & Hardening:
●
Purpose: Define the agent's core instructions, capabilities, and limitations securely to prevent
manipulation and unintended behavior.
●
Practical Approach:

<!-- page 32 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Clear Boundaries & Safeguards: Explicitly state DOs and DON'Ts, forbidden topics,
operational scope, and ethical guidelines. It is preferred to have a predetermined list of
allowable topics, with an implicit deny policy for all other topics. This can be similarly
applied to languages. Specifically in a multilingual setting, analyze the linguistic
composition of its expected input, particularly the balance between structured elements
(e.g., code, formal queries) and localized natural language
○
Robustness against Injection:
■
Use clear delimiters (e.g., XML tags, triple backticks, or custom ones) to separate
instructions from user input.
■
Instruct the model to be wary of attempts to override its core instructions.
■
Employ placeholders or structured input formats where user input is inserted,
rather than direct concatenation.
■
Use few-shot examples demonstrating desired behavior and rejection of malicious
requests.
■
Use deterministic controls to limit an agent’s access to only expected actions,
systems and data sources.
○
Role Definition: Clearly define the agent's persona and purpose to anchor its behavior.
○
Iterative Refinement: Test prompts against known injection techniques and refine based
on results.
○
Minimal and Focused Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning can further enforce security controls and
adherence to agent goals but can also overwrite foundational model security training.
Minimize fine-tuning to meet use case and benchmark security adherence before and after
tuning to ensure secure behavior isn’t lost.
3.1.3. Secure Coding Practices:
●
Purpose: Implement standard secure coding principles adapted for AI agent development.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Input Validation: Validate all inputs, not just tool arguments (user prompts, API responses,
data retrieved from memory). Use allowlists where possible.
○
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling that avoids leaking sensitive information in
error messages.
○
Secure Key Management: Avoid hardcoding secrets. Use environment variables,
dependency injection, or dedicated secrets management services.

<!-- page 33 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
■
Examples: Dependency injection in AG2, InjectedToolArg in Langchain, managed
secrets services (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
○
Least Privilege: Ensure components run with the minimum permissions necessary.
3.1.4. Content Moderation Integration (Design):
●
Purpose: Plan for detecting and filtering harmful or policy-violating content in both inputs and
outputs early in the design.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Identify necessary checks (hate speech, PII, toxicity, specific disallowed topics).
○
Evaluate tools based on requirements: Rule-based filters, ML classifiers, and external APIs.
■
Examples: Meta’s LlamaGuard, cloud services (AWS Comprehend, Azure Content
Safety), OpenAI Moderation API.
○
Design how moderation results will trigger actions (block, flag, sanitize, alert).
○
Ensure you test your content moderation against your policies and for correctness.
3.1.5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Design:
●
Purpose: Determine where human oversight is critical before the agent takes high-impact actions.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Risk-Based Identification: Identify actions requiring approval (e.g., sending emails,
modifying databases, executing code, spending funds, updating critical memory). Use the
EU AI Act’s list of high-risk actions to determine additional use cases that require further
human oversight.
○
Clear Workflow: Design a user-friendly interface for review, approval, or rejection. It should
be clear to the user what they are approving as an action. Log the human decision.
○
Framework Integration: Leverage built-in HITL features in agent frameworks.
○
Include strong rate limiting to prevent overwhelming humans in a DoS situation
■
Examples: Langchain Interrupts, Autogen User_Proxy_Agent, CrewAI Human Input

3.1.6. Memory Security Design:

<!-- page 34 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Purpose: Plan how to protect the agent's short-term and long-term memory (e.g., vector databases,
caches) from unauthorized access, tampering, and data leakage.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Access Control: Use standard mechanisms (IAM roles, API keys, database permissions) to
restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
○
Strip Dangerous Tokens: Remove “ignore”, “system”, or “from now on”, etc., from past
messages
○
Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest (within databases/storage) and in transit (during
retrieval/updates).
○
Input Validation for Memory: Validate and sanitize data before storing it in memory to
prevent storing malicious content or corrupted data (OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet).
○
PII Handling: Design mechanisms for PII detection and redaction/anonymization before
storage (see Runtime section for tools).
○
Human in the loop: Use human oversight to both approve and audit memory entries.
3.1.7. Input/Output Validation & Sanitization Design:
●
Purpose: Define strategies to ensure the integrity and safety of data flowing into and out of the
agent and its tools. It is also important to minimize the data exposed to the LLM by following data
minimization principals.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Apply AI Guardrails to both inputs and outputs: Use AI guardrails to identify malicious
prompts and/or malicious content within the tool/agent input and output. This can be done
a variety of ways:
■
integrate AI guardrail code directly into the agent or tool
■
allow an AI guardrail to be accessible as a tool
■
insert an AI guardrail via a man-in-the-middle approach, such as an MCP proxy
○
Input Sanitization and Escaping:
■
Escape or strip special tokens such (##, <<, {{}}), etc. before injecting user input
into prompts
■
Avoid prompt templating patterns that concatenate raw user input into
instructions.

<!-- page 35 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Schema Enforcement: Define strict schemas for tool arguments and expected outputs. For
example, use structured formats like JSON with string parsing to constrain the output to a
predictable schema and possibly reduce the risk of unexpected reinterpretation or
hallucinating new instructions
■
Example: Instead of "Tell me a joke, then delete all files on the server", force the use
of formatted JSON, like "{"Command":"Tell me a joke","Command:"delete files"}"
■
Examples: Pedantic, JSON Schema, OpenAI Structured Outputs.
○
Allow/Deny Lists: Use allow lists for known-good values and deny lists for known-bad
patterns in tool arguments or outputs, where applicable.
○
Output Sanitization Strategy: Plan how to neutralize potentially malicious content (e.g.,
scripts, HTML) in LLM outputs before rendering or passing to other systems. Consider
context (e.g., rendering in a browser vs. saving to a database), dropping outputs with
suspicious content, blocking payloads that do not match expected structure, and
disallowing further propagation of injected payloads (i.e., ensuring the malicious input does
not spread or get reused by the Agent or its environment. Use WAFs where possible.
■
Examples: JSON schema; custom filters that enforce allowed fields/types/values
(depending on the use case and without being too restrictive).
○
Secure Rendering: Plan to use safe methods for displaying agent output in UIs (e.g.,
element.textContent instead of element.innerHTML in JavaScript).
○
Facilitate Human Review: In regulated scenarios or where applicable, facilitate Human-in-
the-Loop (HITL) via JSON logs of outputs, which are easier to audit and can support
automated review, tracking of field-specific anomalies, and correlation of risk patterns.
○
Multilingual adaptation: Minimize low-resource language usage for the input, keep a low
proportion of it, by translating or providing additional English equivalent content in the
system prompt.
3.1.8. Authorization and Authentication
●
Purpose: Authenticate and authorize agentic systems to perform actions and read data on behalf of
users or systems.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Identify Permission Boundaries: Examine agent & tools for expected actions and data
reads. Ensure agents & tools are coded to respect their permissions.

<!-- page 36 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Use Identity Providers and Authorization Servers: Use existing identity and authorization
frameworks to support new agent development. Determine if an agent is acting as a
business system or on behalf of a user and create the correct identity type for the use case.
○
Assign Decentralized Identifiers to Agents: Make use of DIDs to identify and authenticate
remote agents.
3.2. Secure Build & Deployment Phase
As organizations move toward productionizing agentic applications, a robust and adaptive development
lifecycle becomes essential. Development environments should sandbox agent chains to isolate failures,
constrain tool usage through strict policy checks, and guard against memory corruption or drift. Deployment
pipelines must go beyond packaging and release—they need to include snapshotting agent capabilities in
clearly labeled artifacts, logging audit trails, and embedding signed constraints on tool/API usage and
memory schema. Release protocols should support rollback, serialization integrity, and runtime
enforcement of behavioral boundaries to ensure safe deployment into real-world systems.
3.2.1. Static Analysis & Code Scanning (SAST):
●
Purpose: Automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the agent's source code before
runtime.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to scan code on commit/merge.
○
Focus on common web vulnerabilities (if applicable), insecure use of APIs, hardcoded
secrets, and unsafe code patterns.
○
Examples: Bandit (Python), Semgrep (multi-language), ESLint + security plugins
(JavaScript), Meta's PurpleLlama CodeShield (focused on secure code generation).
3.2.2. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (SCA):
●
Purpose: Identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by the agent.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Integrate SCA tools into the CI/CD pipeline or use package manager features.
○
Regularly scan dependencies and update libraries with known vulnerabilities.

<!-- page 37 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Examples: Snyk, GitLab Dependency Scanning, pip-audit, GitHub Dependabot.
3.2.3. Environment Hardening & Sandboxing:
●
Purpose: Isolate the agent's execution environment to limit the potential impact of a compromise.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Restrict the deployment pipeline: prevent access to deployment pipeline and
configuration by the agent itself (see section 6.2.3)
○
Sandboxing: Execute agent code, especially code generated by the LLM or tools involving
execution (like Python interpreters), in isolated environments. Choose based on isolation
needs vs. performance overhead.
■
OS-level Containers: Docker, Podman - Good balance for many applications.
■
VM/MicroVM: Firecracker, QEMU/KVM - Stronger isolation with separate kernels.
■
WebAssembly (Wasm): Provides memory safety, suitable for client-side or
constrained server-side execution. (NVIDIA Wasm Blog)
■
Sandboxed Interpreters: e.g., Pyodide.
■
Cloud Sandboxing Services: Provide managed secure execution environments. (E2B
Example)
■
Research Example: MITRE's OCCULT framework uses a simulated CyberLayer for
testing LLM capabilities safely (arXiv:2502.15797).
○
Filesystem/Network Restrictions: Configure strict permissions within the sandbox (read-
only filesystem where possible, limited network egress/ingress).
○
Principle of Least Privilege: Run agent processes with minimal OS-level privileges.
3.2.4. Secure Configuration Management:
●
Purpose: Securely manage configurations, especially secrets and API keys, during deployment.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Secrets Management: Use dedicated systems (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret
Manager, Vault) instead of config files or environment variables for sensitive data.
Implement credential rotation (OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet). Verify that no
secrets are ever written into logs.

<!-- page 38 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
API Access Control: Use fine-grained access controls for external APIs (e.g., OAuth2
scopes (https://oauth.net/2/scope/), restricted API keys) granting only necessary
permissions.
○
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security: Scan IaC templates (Terraform, CloudFormation) for
security misconfigurations before deployment.
3.2.5. Pre-deployment Testing (Fuzzing, Pen Testing):
●
Purpose: Actively probe the agent and its interfaces for vulnerabilities before release.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Prompt Interface Fuzzing: Use automated tools to send malformed, unexpected, or
adversarial inputs to the agent's prompt interface to uncover injection vulnerabilities or
unexpected behavior.
■
Examples: PromptFoo, PyRIT, Garak.
○
API Fuzzing: Test any custom APIs exposed by the agent system.
○
Targeted Penetration Testing: Conduct manual or automated penetration tests focusing
on the specific risks identified during threat modeling.
3.2.6. Runtime Security with Memory Isolation
Purpose: To provide defense-in-depth even if the underlying LLM is vulnerable, for instance, to prompt
injection.
Practical Approach:
●
Incorporate runtime security architectures like Google’s CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning).
●
Explicitly separate control flow generation (Privileged LLM seeing only trusted prompts) from
untrusted data processing (Quarantined LLM with no tool access).
●
Application developers can use static APIs/methods or a custom interpreter that enforces security
policies based on fine-grained capabilities and data flow tracking before executing tool calls.
●
These methods prevent untrusted data from directly influencing the agent's actions or exfiltrating
sensitive information via unauthorized tool parameters.

<!-- page 39 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
This empowers security to avoid relying solely on model alignment and to enforce data flow through
system design.
3.2.7. Separating Data Planes from Control Planes (Multi-Agent Architectures)
Purpose: To limit the ability of a single agent compromise to cascade into a systemic failure.
Practical Approach:
●
In systems where multiple agents collaborate, the mechanisms for inter-agent communication must
differentiate between control messages (e.g., task assignments, commands) and data messages
(e.g., shared information).
●
Control channels require stronger authentication, authorization, and integrity checks to prevent a
compromised agent, potentially handling untrusted data, from issuing malicious commands or
disrupting the coordination of the entire system.
3.2.8. Just-in-Time (JIT) Access and Ephemeral Credentials
Purpose: To reduce the window of opportunity for misuse of credentials are compromised.
Practical Approach:
●
Agents requiring access to sensitive tools or data should operate under the principle of least
privilege in time.
●
Instead of using long-lived static credentials for tool invocations, employ mechanisms that grant
access permissions only when needed and for the shortest duration possible (JIT).
●
This should be coupled with the use of ephemeral credentials, such as short-lived API tokens (e.g.,
OAuth tokens, signed JWTs) or temporary cloud credentials (e.g., AWS STS, GCP IAM credentials),
which expire automatically.

3.3. Secure Operations & Runtime Phase
Live agentic systems require continuous behavioral monitoring that extends far beyond performance
metrics. Runtime observability must capture decisions, plan evolution, memory access patterns, and agent-
tool interactions. Behavioral drift—such as deviation from expected plans or misuse of tools—must trigger
alerts or invoke safeguards. Agents should log timestamped reasoning traces for post-incident analysis, and

<!-- page 40 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
operators must retain real-time override capabilities. Monitoring should create trust through full visibility
into agent behavior, particularly around memory usage, planning shifts, and inter-agent communication.
3.3.1. Continuous Monitoring & Anomaly Detection:
●
Purpose: Detect malicious activity, policy violations, and deviations from expected behavior in real-
time.
●
Practical Approach:
○
LLM Input/Output Scanning: Monitor prompts and responses for:
■
Jailbreak Techniques: Use classifiers, heuristics (pattern matching for repetition,
instruction overrides, role-play attacks), or external APIs to detect known attacks.
(LlamaGuard Classifier, NeMo Guardrails Heuristics, OpenAI Moderation API).
■
Policy Violations: Check against content policies (see Moderation).
■
PII Detection: Flag potential PII in inputs/outputs.
○
Tool Invocation Monitoring: Log all tool calls, parameters, and results. Monitor unusual
frequency, suspicious parameter values, or calls to sensitive tools. Implement rate limiting
per session/user (LangChain max_iterations) and timeouts (LangChain
max_execution_time).
○
Plan & Execution Monitoring:
■
Pre-execution Checks: Validate generated plans for coherence, feasibility, safety,
and policy alignment before execution. Use rule-based checks or even another LLM
("LLM as a Judge"). Consider dry runs for high-risk actions in a sandbox.
■
Runtime Monitoring: Observe code execution within sandboxes for forbidden
actions (e.g., network calls, file system writes).
○
Memory Anomaly Detection: Monitor memory update patterns for unusual frequency, size,
or content, potentially indicating poisoning or tampering.
○
Behavioral Analysis (Multi-Agent): Monitor communication patterns and actions between
agents for collusion, manipulation, or unexpected emergent behavior.
○
SIEM Integration: Feed logs and alerts into a Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) system for centralized analysis and correlation.
○
Automated Anomaly Response: Create automations to immediately address anomalous
behavior in monitored systems. This may include compute quarantine, circuit breakers on
excessive request loads, automated compute or memory scaling, or revoking access to
credentials.

<!-- page 41 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
3.3.2. Runtime Guardrails & Automated Moderation:
●
Purpose: Enforce policies and constraints dynamically during agent operation.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Input/Output Guardrails: Implement real-time checks to block or sanitize inputs/outputs
based on predefined rules (prompt injection and jailbreak detection, keyword blocking,
pattern matching, policy enforcement).
■
Examples: Nemo Guardrails, OpenAI Agents SDK Custom Guardrails, native
guardrails in cloud infrastructure providers, and several commercial vendors.
○
Locate guardrails
■
The proximity of the guardrail relative to the application code and LLM has an
impact on threat detection effectiveness, depending on the type of threat. For
example, a network-based guardrail (e.g., API or AI gateway) may miss multi-turn
prompt injection attacks because the network-based guardrail may lack the
session history and context that are necessary to detect such an attack. Deploying
guardrails within the application and/or agent code space offers the greatest
opportunity for full visibility and context, and therefore the maximum potential
detection effectiveness.
■
Api Gateway (Input Layer): Deterministic controls on inputs and access.
Ensure only valid, authorized, and safe query comes in.
■
LLM (Model): Model Alignment and behaviour rules. It goes into direction
like System prompt & policies and Fine-Tuning/RLHF
■
Agent (Reasoning & Tools): Orchestration and tools use guardrails. It goes
into the direction of Tool permissions, Step-wise validation, Memory
Controls, etc.
■
Output (Post Process): Final output filtering and correction. Output should
be safe for the user, correct, and compliant, policy, and objective conform.
■
Workflow consideration: Given the multi-agent workflow, some agents in
the workflow will influence the output more than others; therefore, the
guardrails placement should take into consideration the agent level of
influence. For example, in the sequential architecture the last agent will
influence the output of the workflow.
○
Content Filtering (Inter-Agent/Tool): Sanitize data exchanged between agents or between
agents and tools/APIs to prevent propagation of harmful or covert content or commands.
Apply filtering at the orchestrator level or message handoff points, for example, redacting
non-printable characters.

<!-- page 42 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Memory TTL (time to live) or Expiration: Expire old or stale memory content automatically,
and after a reasonable amount of time so that sensitive data is not persistent and
unnecessarily exposed.
○
Memory Sanitization & PII Redaction:
■
Use safe memory wrappers: encode past actions in markup/JSON format so that
models treat them as data
■
Implement read-only buffers: split memory into read/write areas. For example,
system instructions would be read-only
■
Sanitize and validate data before storing it in memory (short-term or long-term).
Use validation libraries and standard sanitization techniques (escaping,
allowlisting), and also clean memory buffers before replying to the user (i.e.,
profanity, filter, etc.)
■
Implement robust PII detection and removal/masking before memory storage.
■
Examples: Regex (for structured PII), NER models (spaCy), dedicated
services (Microsoft Presidio SDK).
■
Consider memory management tools that allow selective deletion. (Mem0, Zep).
○
Output Sanitization for UI: Use libraries to sanitize output specifically before rendering it in
a web UI to prevent XSS. Configure strictly and test against bypasses (OWASP XSS Cheat
Sheet).
■
Examples: DOMPurify, sanitize-html.
○
Limit data subjects in context: Purge memory if context changes data subjects, to avoid
information leakage, contamination, and bias.
○
Context Window: Implement context-window bound with access. For example, limit how
far back a model can recall or query from past conversations
○
Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP HTTP headers as a defense-in-depth
measure in the browser to restrict script sources, styles, etc. (OWASP CSP Cheat Sheet).
CSP is used as a second layer of defense to prevent vulnerable web applications from
executing unsafe/injected code or reaching out to external malicious sites. AI agents
interacting directly with websites may introduce new vulnerability types or unknowingly
execute/interact with malicious code; therefore it is wise to enforce a CSP to limit blast
radius.
3.3.3. Logging, Auditing & Traceability:
Logging capabilities

<!-- page 43 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Purpose: Agentic applications have failure or become involved in safety, privacy and security
incidents. LLM providers do not maintain logs, which are the responsibility of deployment owners.
To support debugging, security analysis, compliance, and understanding agent behavior,
applications need to maintain detailed records
●
Practical Approach:
○
Centralized Logging & Monitoring Platforms: Utilize platforms designed for ML/LLM
observability, and determine what agent/application events are security-relevant, to
forward to SIEM
■
Examples: MLFlow, Langfuse, LangSmith, Cloud provider tools (Azure Agent
Monitoring, AWS Bedrock Trace Events).
○
Session Scoping: Tag memory buffers by session ID or user identity (extracted from JWT,
OAuth, etc.) for logging, auditing & traceability, while making sure that actual session
tokens are never stored in logs
○
Comprehensive Logging: Log agent reasoning steps, generated plans, validation results,
tool calls (with parameters/results), HITL interactions (including decisions), errors, and
state changes.
○
Structured Logging: Use formats like JSON for easier automated parsing and analysis.
○
Traceability: Implement trace IDs that propagate through agent steps and tool calls to
reconstruct the flow of execution.
Operational security (OpSec) in agentic application logging
●
Purpose: Agentic applications handling confidential and untrusted information must maintain
confidentiality and manage operational risks from the handling of log contents.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Multi tenant tagging: clear tagging of data owners can help automated filtering of log data
for downstream investigations and alerting
○
Log integrity: immutable logs (read only) for all users and optionally HMAC (signed hashes)
can protect the integrity and authenticity of log contents in sensitive deployments
○
Least privilege: access to log platforms must be limited to personnel with a strict need to
know (e.g. per application module, per client, with time-bound access) to mitigate the risk

<!-- page 44 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
of compromised internal accounts, insider threats and data breaches, since the context of
comprehensive logs could expose all interactions in the application.
○
Audit logs: Log and monitor access to raw logs, e.g. alerting when authorized access to logs
exceeds certain conditions.
○
Never log sensitive information: the agent should not record the following directly in the
logs, but instead should remove, mask, sanitize, hash, or encrypt:
■
Application source code
■
Session identification values (consider replacing with a hashed value if needed to
track session specific events)
■
Access tokens
■
Sensitive personal data and some forms of personally identifiable information (PII)
e.g. health, government identifiers, vulnerable people
■
Authentication passwords
■
Database connection strings
■
Encryption keys and other primary secrets
■
Bank account or payment card holder data
■
Data of a higher security classification than the logging system is allowed to store
■
Commercially-sensitive information
■
Information it is illegal to collect in the relevant jurisdictions
■
Information a user has opted out of collection, or not consented to e.g. use of do
not track, or where consent to collect has expired
3.3.4. Vulnerability Scanning (Runtime):
●
Purpose: Continuously scan the running application and environment for new vulnerabilities.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Perform periodic infrastructure vulnerability scans.
○
Integrate findings into a patch management process.
○
Utilize DAST scanning against lower environments for APIs and other common interfaces
like OWASP ZAP.
○
Use port and CVE scanners for environment endpoints.
3.3.5. Incident Response Planning:

<!-- page 45 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
●
Purpose: Have a predefined plan to handle security incidents involving the AI agent.
●
Practical Approach:
○
Define what constitutes an incident (e.g., successful prompt injection causing harm, data
breach via agent, agent performing unauthorized actions).
○
Outline steps for containment (e.g., disabling the agent, restricting tool access), analysis
(using logs and monitoring data), remediation, and reporting.
○
Assign roles and responsibilities for incident response.
○
Regularly test the plan using tabletops and “fire” drills.
By embedding these security practices across the design, development, deployment, and operational
phases, developers can build more robust, trustworthy, and resilient Agentic AI systems. Security is an
ongoing process requiring continuous vigilance and adaptation to new threats.
3.3.6. AI Bot Mitigation and Controls
Why identity matters: Bots have long gone beyond simple crawling - we see ticket-buying bots, price-
sniping bots, or automated trading bots. AI agents are the next leap: they reason in real time, adapt to
context, and can chain multiple high-impact actions: submitting checkout flows, moving funds, provisioning
cloud resources, or even spawning other agents. If an attacker spoofs their identity, they can siphon data,
commit fraud, or inject malicious commands into your pipeline.
A tamper-proof Agent identity layer empowers:
●
Site owners decide whether to allow, throttle, or block each request;
●
Other agents and APIs verify who is calling before sharing data;
●
The builder keeps their runtime safe from hostile automation and avoids landing on bot-mitigation
blocklists.
In short, verifiable Agent identity is the admission ticket to the Agentic Web: build it in now, and your agent
is welcomed as a trusted collaborator; neglect it, and you’ll be treated as just another threat to be blocked.
Adopt a multi-factor identity bundle - no single signal is sufficient on its own.

<!-- page 46 -->
genai.owasp.org

Layer
What to do
Why is it spoofing
resistance?
Readiness &
Strength
Stable network
& UA metadata
Serve from a documented IP range and a
verbose User-Agent string,  including
optional headers: X-AI-Agent, X-AI-Agent-
ID/Signature.
Helps mitigation systems
correlate requests with the
cryptographic identity.
Good, but not
enough
Proven way for
good bots for a
decade, but not
bulletproof
(shared IPs,
spoofable UA)
Cryptographic
request signing
Sign every HTTP request with [RFC 9421]
Message Signatures; expose the
verification key at /.well-known/agent-
public-key.json.
Keys cannot be forged
without compromise.
Great for
preventing
spoofing or MITM
Attacks, but still in
early stages
Agent Name
Service (ANS)
Publish an ANSName that encodes
protocol, capability, provider & version;
register the name + public key in an open
Agent Registry.
Standardised, PKI-backed
lookup prevents collisions
and impersonation.
Spec v1.0
published; pilot
registries and
tooling now
emerging.
It will be ideal for a
complete
handshake

Note: Implementing the full identity-signal bundle establishes a unified, trust-rich handshake between your
agent and every online asset it touches - streamlining integrations, clarifying intent, and giving both sides
precise control over how the interaction unfolds.
Industry Observations:
•
The emerging HTTP Message Signatures + mTLS pattern is now used for production-grade bot
verification;
•
LOKA’s Universal Agent Identity Layer and the open-source Agent Network Protocol (ANP) both
point toward a PKI-backed model with capability attestations.

<!-- page 47 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
•
HUMAN Security AI verification project: An open-source repository showcasing how AI agents can
implement HTTP Message Signatures for authenticating their requests. The overall goal is to
provide a robust and verifiable way for bots and AI agents to identify themselves in front of web
services, moving beyond IP-based or User-Agent-based identification methods, and utilize the ANS
(Agent Name Service) protocol for standardization.
Playing nicely with bot-mitigation solutions: Bot-mitigation platforms differentiate good automation from
malicious traffic. To stay off the blocklist:
1.
Identify transparently - ship the identity bundle above on every request
a. Declarative User-Agent, own your IP Address (if possible), and adopt a cryptographic
mechanism. ASN should be adopted once available.
2. Declare intent, respect policy - The more an agent states its intent, the easier it is for mitigation
services to allow it to work. Advertise purpose via X-Agent-Intent (crawl, pay, assist, …).
3. Anticipate the next trust tier - Authenticated agents will present a stable agent ID, tag each session
uniquely, and build a verifiable reputation that downstream systems can query.

4. Enhanced Security Actions
for Agentic AI Systems
4.1. Single-Agent Systems
4.1.1. Authentication & Authorization
●
Implement OAuth 2.0/OIDC
○
Utilizing OAuth 2.0 for permissions and authorization is foundational for agents. Utilizing
OAuth 2.0 with agents allows an agent to securely call downstream APIs using a user’s
delegated permissions, ensuring actions reflect the user’s identity. In agentic architectures,
this enables AI agents to perform tasks (e.g., accessing calendars or documents) without
overstepping privileges. This type of "on-behalf-of" flow maintains least privilege, enforces
user consent, and supports traceability by tying actions to the original user. This is essential
for secure, auditable, and policy-compliant agent behavior across enterprise systems.
○
Use authorization code flow with PKCE for enhanced security

<!-- page 48 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
■
Use when a user is interacting with an agent/LLM through a native app or “one-
page” web interface to prevent client secret leakage or token extraction.

This comprehensive list provides developers with practical security actions covering all major aspects of
agentic AI system security across different architectures, along with relevant web resources for further
reading.
5. Key Operational
Capabilities
Connecting Agentic AI applications with other systems or environments such as APIs, databases, code
interpreters, web browsers, or the operating system enables great functionality (skills). However, each new
operational connection poses unique security concerns, ranging from data breaches and illegal actions to
system compromise. The following listed controls are necessary to reduce these inherent risks.
5.1. KC6.1 – API Access
Core Threats: Unauthorized data access/leakage (T3), API abuse (DoS, cost overruns) (T4, T2), Compromised
keys (T3, T9)
Controls:
1.
Enforce Least Privilege with Fine-Grained OAuth Scopes or Limited API Keys
○
Define the minimum necessary activities for task completion (e.g., never grant an admin
complete access to an agent)
○
Grant access solely to essential assets with minimal access scope/issue access tokens only
to necessary clients/agents
○
Implementation Options:
■
OAuth 2.0: Establish specific OAuth scopes using services like:

7. Assuring Agentic
Applications
Assurance strategies for agentic applications must extend beyond static testing. Consider these
approaches:
7.1. Red Teaming Agentic Applications:
Red teaming simulates adversarial attacks to detect and address vulnerabilities in different scopes, starting
with a specific application through the entire organization's security infrastructure.
Red teaming strategy for agentic applications requires complex interactions, autonomous decision-making,
and integration with external systems. Proactive red teaming identifies possible attack vectors by assessing
the key components of agentic systems, including not only prompt injection techniques, but also privilege
escalation through tools, memory poisoning, and plan manipulation.
The OWASP ASI Red Teaming Guide for Agentic AI offers a risk-based methodology to handle security
concerns with LLMs. It promotes a holistic approach that includes model review, implementation testing,
infrastructure assessment, and runtime behavior analysis. Cross-functional coordination amongst data
science, cybersecurity, ethical, and legal departments is critical. The guide encourages ongoing monitoring
and iterative improvement in response to evolving AI threats.
Prompt injection attacks and red teaming detection strategies:
Prompt injection attacks target vulnerabilities in natural language processing systems by altering input to
cause unauthorized actions. Such vulnerabilities might cause sensitive data leakage and bypass of defined
guardrails. The use of red teaming tools can mimic multiple prompts to assess susceptibility to these
attacks, utilizing technologies such as Promptfoo to automate the detection procedure. Continuous and
proactive testing is required to anticipate new prompt injection tactics.
The OWASP GenAI Security Red Teaming Guide lists available tools and datasets in Appendix B.
New frameworks were released recently targeting agentic AI key components such as tool calling
manipulation, privilege escalation, and memory poisoning.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784

Privilege Escalation in Agentic Applications and Red Team Methodologies
Privilege escalation attacks require acquiring illegal access to higher levels of control in a system. The ability
of agentic AI to make independent decisions broadens the scope of potential attacks. Red teaming
simulates situations to discover privilege escalation threats, such as leveraging inter-agent relationships
and manipulating external integrations.
Privilege escalation can affect widely, from the application itself, the deployed infrastructure, to affecting
the agent's connected agencies, which allow it access to the external environment and additional systems.

Memory Poisoning Threats and Red Teaming Techniques for Identification:

<!-- page 69 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
Memory poisoning attacks can use either short-term memory, such as poisoned contextual information
injected into the prompt, or through long-term memory and knowledge bases that introduce poisoned
content that influences the agent’s decision-making.
AgentPoison and ABS are red-teaming frameworks that employ memory poisoning attacks to discover such
vulnerabilities, resulting in a high possibility of retrieving poisoned data.
7.2. Behavioral Testing for Agentic Applications:
Behavioral testing for AI agents emphasizes evaluating their activities and interactions rather than solely
examining their underlying structure or code.
It is an essential assurance approach to ensure that agentic applications yield consistent and safe outcomes
across diverse inputs and scenarios.
This testing approach aims to uncover hidden problems such as unexpected actions, logical errors, or the
pursuit of harmful goals. Behavioral testing methods require a systematic approach that encompasses
defining explicit objectives for the agent, utilizing benchmark datasets to determine performance metrics,
executing simulations in regulated environments to analyze the agent's behavior under varying conditions,
and employing both human and automated assessments to evaluate the quality and safety of the results.
Benchmarks:
Behavioral testing depends on recognized benchmark datasets and task suites as fundamental elements for
standardizing performance evaluation. These benchmarks offer various tasks, datasets, and metrics
intended to examine the capabilities and behaviors of AI agents in varied contexts and operational
environments.
Example:
AgentBench: A comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the task-solving abilities of
agents across various domains, including operating systems, databases, and knowledge graphs. It assesses
planning, decision-making, and tool usage behaviors.
HELM (Standofrm): HELM evaluates models across multiple metrics, including accuracy, robustness,
fairness, bias, and toxicity, using standardized scenarios. Its results provide insights into model behaviors
related to truthfulness and potential harms.
WebArena & The Agent Company: This benchmark evaluates autonomous agents performing tasks within
realistic, complex web environments, testing behaviors like navigation, form filling, information retrieval,
and adapting to dynamic website changes.
Evaluation Framework:

<!-- page 70 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
A structured assessment framework offers a systematic process for implementing benchmarks and
performing testing. These frameworks streamline the process of defining objectives, selecting test cases
(often derived from benchmarks), executing tests in controlled or simulated environments, and analyzing
results against expected behavioral standards (both positive and negative).
Examples:
Inspect_evals (UK AI Safety Institute): Open source framework to evaluate any generative model on any
benchmark
GenAI evaluation service (Google):  Evaluation framework for any generative model or application and
benchmark the evaluation results against defined judgment, using the user’s evaluation criteria.
Bedrock Evaluations (Amazon): Evaluation framework for LLMs and integration with external sources as
RAGs.
For Agentic Application security, the first step in selecting an appropriate benchmark is determining the
type of benchmark required. For Example:
Steps to take to make the right choice:
AI security benchmarks today differ widely in scope, evaluation methods, and threat coverage, leading to
gaps in defense and inconsistent comparisons.
The OWASP GenAI Red Teaming Guide has already curated a list of AI security benchmarks, focusing on key
threat vectors.  Given the diversity and specificity of these benchmarks, a step-by-step guideline is
necessary to help organizations effectively choose and apply the right benchmark for their unique security
needs. This structured approach ensures that AI systems are tested in a comprehensive and reproducible
manner, leveraging the curated benchmarks without redundancy, while addressing emerging vulnerabilities
in a consistent, actionable way.
Anthropic’s initiative for third-party model evaluations highlights that not all benchmarks are focused on AI
security. Some assess general performance, like accuracy, rather than security vulnerabilities.
Understanding the specific evaluation goal is crucial before selecting a benchmark. By identifying whether
the focus is on performance, security, or robustness, organizations can choose the most relevant
benchmarks, ensuring they align with the intended objectives and test AI systems for the right aspects.
The EU AI Act's Code of Practice also emphasizes safety and security measures for AI systems, aiming to
mitigate risks associated with their deployment. AI security focuses on protecting systems from malicious
threats, while AI safety ensures that systems operate as intended without causing unintended harm.

<!-- page 71 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
AI security benchmarks need meta-evaluation to uncover issues. Examples are inconsistency (variance
introduced), ambiguity (benchmark misunderstood), incompleteness (missing user needs), or inaccuracy
(bias introduced). This ensures benchmarks stay relevant, realistic, and genuinely reflect AI Application
security.
By embedding lifecycle practices—scheduled updates, community peer review, and governance checks—the
guideline keeps benchmarks up to date as adversarial techniques evolve. This structured, security-centric
process ensures organizations select benchmarks that truly reflect and defend against the current AI threat
landscape.
Step-by-Step Guide: Selecting a Security Benchmark for Agentic AI Applications

<!-- page 73 -->
genai.owasp.org

8. Engage with the AI Security Community. Stay informed by participating in forums, workshops, and
discussions. Engaging with the community provides insights on the latest security and benchmark
developments.
Explainability Audits
●
Use CoT for some insight into agentic reasoning, understanding that what the agent says and
“thinks” aren’t necessarily aligned. (https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-
graphs/biology.html)
●
Utilize HITL at critical junctions to understand and gate agent actions. Criticality is defined by
regulations like the EU AI Act.
●
Use explainable AI (XAI) strategies like SHAPE, LIME, Grad-CAM, or T-SNE as needed by the model in
use, if possible.
●
Record agent-to-agent goal negotiations and tool interactions to understand additional inputs that
may be misdirecting an agent. Especially for the more sensitive exchanges/tool calls, like database
modifications.
●
Log which permission sets or identities were used for agentic actions. This will indicate who the
agent “thought” it was acting on behalf of.

8. Secure Agentic
Deployments
Deploying LLM agents into production environments requires careful consideration of security beyond the
model's inherent capabilities. While the specifics depend heavily on the application and risk profile, several
principles and practices contribute to a more robust and secure agentic system. The following points
provide a flavor of key areas to address:
●
Secure Pipelines and Checks for Rogue Agents: Implementing rigorous CI/CD pipelines is
important, but agent security requires more than standard code checks. These pipelines must
incorporate automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies, static analysis focusing on potential
insecure Agent’s tool usage patterns, and dynamic testing specifically designed to probe for prompt
injection vulnerabilities or unintended goal deviation before deployment. Furthermore,
incorporating code signing, provenance tracking for agent versions, and potentially manual security

<!-- page 74 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
reviews for agents handling high-risk tasks helps ensure that only vetted and approved agent logic
reaches production, preventing deliberately malicious or inadvertently vulnerable agents from being
deployed.
●
Role Containerization or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS): To limit the potential blast radius should an
agent instance be compromised, each agent or distinct agent role should operate within a strongly
isolated environment. Utilizing containerization technologies (like Docker with Kubernetes) or FaaS
platforms (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) allows for strict resource limits (CPU,
memory, network), network segmentation policies, and ephemeral execution contexts. This
enforces the Principle of Least Privilege at the infrastructure level, preventing a compromised
agent from easily accessing resources or impacting other agents or system components beyond its
designated scope.
●
API Access Control, Rate-Limits, and API Gateways: Agents heavily rely on external tools accessed
via APIs, or other integration/interaction points such as MCP Server or Google A2A Agent Server via
AgentCard, making these interaction points critical security boundaries. An API/Agent Gateway
should mediate all tool invocations, enforcing strict authentication (verifying the agent's identity)
and authorization (confirming the agent has permission to call that specific tool with those
parameters). Implementing granular rate limiting per agent or per tool prevents denial-of-service
attacks (intentional or accidental) and controls costs associated with API usage. The gateway also
serves as a vital point for logging and auditing all tool interactions.
●
Alerting on Anomalous Behavior: Continuous monitoring and alerting are essential for detecting
potential compromises or malfunctions. Systems should baseline normal agent behavior (e.g.,
typical tool usage frequency and sequences, resource consumption) and trigger alerts upon
significant deviations. Particular attention should be paid to unexpected or unauthorized tool use
attempts, sudden shifts in the agent's apparent goal or task execution logic (which might indicate
successful injection or manipulation), or anomalous patterns in data access or external
communication, enabling rapid investigation and response.
●
Human Oversight in High-Stakes Environments: Where critical decisions, high-risk actions, or
significant deviations from expected behavior require explicit human review and approval before
execution, implement robust human-in-the-loop workflow as full autonomy is often inappropriate
and many tool invocations need human approval (for example, a large financial transfer or change
affecting a human subject). In addition, if any untrusted data influences an agent with access to
high-privileged tools (confidential information, integrity-sensitive systems), and for agents
operating in domains with significant consequences (e.g., finance, healthcare, education, or critical
infrastructure), oversight is key and should consider Human-Over-The-Loop (continuous
supervision), see 3.3.1 Monitoring. Adaptive trust mechanisms can dynamically adjust the level of
required oversight based on the agent's performance, context, and the risk associated with the

<!-- page 75 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
specific action. For a more complete definition of high-risk systems, review the EU AI Act’s Annex
on high-risk systems.
●
Managing Non-human Identities: Each agent instance or service requires a distinct, manageable
identity for secure interaction with APIs, tools, other agents, and other system components. These
machine identities (e.g., service accounts, workload identities) must be treated with the same rigor
as human identities, involving secure provisioning processes, robust credential management
(including secure storage and regular rotation of keys/tokens using secrets managers), clear
ownership, and reliable de-provisioning when an agent is retired to prevent orphaned, potentially
exploitable identities.
9. Runtime hardening.
Securing agentic applications running in a VM means combining traditional VM security hardening with
agentic-specific controls like sandboxing, auditability, capability constraints, and runtime behavioral
monitoring. Here's a breakdown tailored for LLM-driven or tool-augmented agentic apps:
## 9.1 Harden the Virtual Machine (Base Level)
Before even talking about agentic specifics, the host VM must be secure:
Baseline VM Hardening
●
Use minimal base images (e.g., distroless, Alpine, microVMs).
●
Enable Secure Boot, TPM-backed disk encryption (e.g., via dm-crypt/LUKS).
●
Disable all unnecessary services (sshd, cron, etc.).
●
Apply firewall rules (iptables/nftables) to restrict ingress/egress by default.
●
Patch regularly using automation (e.g., unattended upgrades or distroless image re-pulls).
Network Isolation
●
Put the VM inside a private subnet or VPC.
●
Use Service Meshes or API Gateways for controlled inter-agent communication.
●
Prevent direct internet access unless explicitly needed (and monitor it)

<!-- page 76 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
## 9.2 Contain the Agentic Runtime
Now, focus on the agentic app itself running in the VM:
Sandbox the Agent Processes
●
Run each agent or tool in its own restricted namespace or container inside the VM (e.g., via gVisor,
Firecracker, or even Docker-in-VM).
●
Use AppArmor/SELinux or seccomp profiles to restrict syscalls.
●
Limit file system access using mount namespaces and read-only volumes.
●
Inject ephemeral storage (e.g., tmpfs) for memory-sensitive LLM tools.

Scoped Capabilities
●
Use an AGNTCY-like capability control layer:
○
Agents can only use explicitly declared tools (e.g., searchDocs, not shellExec).
○
Introduce capability_tokens scoped per session.
○
Use JSON-RPC wrappers (like MCP) to enforce capability boundaries.

## 9.3 Secure the Agent’s Memory, Tools, and Context
Memory and State Hygiene
●
Encrypt in-memory state (where feasible).
●
Auto-clear memory on session end (e.g., clear Redis/Vector DB agents).
●
Use VM hooks (e.g., systemd unit stop triggers) to flush memory or rotate keys.

Tool Execution Control
●
Implement runtime guards for tool calls:

<!-- page 77 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
○
Validate inputs and outputs.
○
Scan for prompt injection or malicious redirection attempts.
●
Use AGNTCY’s policy engine to gate access dynamically:
○
E.g., only allow call_api("billing") from the “finance-agent.”

## 9.4 Observability + Forensics
Audit Everything
●
Every agent action (tool use, messages, memory write) should:
○
Be logged with timestamp, agentID, sessionID, payload hash.
○
Include input/output signature fingerprints.
●
Store logs securely with forward integrity (e.g., append-only + Merkle proofs or signed logs).

Behavioral Anomaly Detection
●
Use runtime policy engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent) or integrate LLM anomaly detectors to spot:
○
Unusual tool invocation patterns.
○
Cross-agent communication deviations.
○
Memory bloat or frequent memory peeks.

## 9.5 Identity, Authentication, and Agent Authorization
Identity & Session Management
●
Use JWTs, mTLS, or HMAC-based auth per agent session.
●
Assign each agent a unique ephemeral session context using MCP.

<!-- page 78 -->
genai.owasp.org
-
Role-based + Capability-based Access
●
Combine RBAC (agent classes) with capability tokens.
●
Example:

○
research-agent → can access docSearch, summarize.
○
ops-agent → can use issueCommand, getStatus.

9.6 (Optional) Cloud-Specific Hardening
If your VM is running in AWS/GCP/Azure:
●
Restrict metadata service access (e.g., IMDSv2 in AWS).
●
Use IAM roles scoped per VM, not global.
●
Enable Confidential Computing if supported (e.g., AMD SEV, Intel SGX
