Introduction & Background

This cheat sheet is intended for companies and developers who plan to use a third-party MCP, meaning one
that was not developed within their own organization. It isn’t a cheat sheet for MCP developers.
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how LLM/agent hosts connect to
external tools, data, and prompt templates via a server. By connecting models to systems such as
databases, APIs, and internal applications, MCP unlocks powerful automation and allows AI to perform
actions beyond text generation. However, it also presents a new attack surface that could open
organizations up to malicious attacks. Since tools can execute code, access files, and make network calls, a
compromised MCP stack can lead to data theft, malicious code execution, and system sabotage.
MCP uses a simple client-server model over two primary layers: a data layer for API semantics (JSON-RPC)
and a transport layer for communication (e.g., STDIO, Streamable HTTP).
•
MCP Host: The application (e.g., AI agent runtime) that manages clients and routes requests.
•
MCP Client: The connector that communicates with a single MCP server.
•
MCP Server: A program that exposes tools and context (e.g., calendars, SaaS APIs) to clients. MCP
defines three core primitives that servers can expose:
o
Tools: Executable functions that AI applications can invoke to perform actions (e.g., file
operations, API calls, database queries)
o
Resources: Data sources that provide contextual information to AI applications (e.g., file
contents, database records, API responses) to the model.
o
Prompts: Reusable templates that help structure interactions with language models (e.g.,
system prompts, few-shot examples)
This cheat sheet outlines key security controls for developers using a third-party MCP server (using MCP
securely).

Use Cases

A downloadable MCP server that runs locally, using native tools and system-level permissions to perform
tasks independently of external infrastructure. These systems will often use STDIO for communication
between the MCP client and server. While core operations are executed locally, some functionality, such as
LLM execution or remote API calls, may interface with remote services depending on configuration.

This MCP client connects to the server via MCP’s HTTP Streamable communication, with the server running
remotely. The server is capable of interacting with external tools and APIs, often hosted in cloud
environments. Core considerations for this deployment include authentication/authorization, server
discovery, and unreviewed MCP tool changes.

Current Vulnerability
Landscape

Common attack patterns have begun to emerge around MCP, many focused on malicious inputs designed to
influence an LLM, or attacks that impact the tools an LLM calls.
Tool Poisoning & Rug Pull Attacks
Tool poisoning is a form of indirect prompt injection where adversaries embed malicious commands within a
tool's description or parameters. The LLM executes these hidden instructions, potentially leading to
unauthorized data access or unauthorized file system access. A rug pull is a specific type of tool poisoning
where a legitimate tool is secretly replaced with a malicious version, leveraging the trust established by the
original tool to execute the attack.
Mitigations:
•
Enforcing Full Tool Transparency: MCP clients should display the full tool manifest, including
descriptions, parameters, and capabilities, before user activation. Avoid rendering shortened
summaries that can hide injected instructions.
•
Sanitize Descriptions: Review descriptions for suspicious keywords or markup. Refer to the OWASP
LLM Prompt Injection Prevention Cheatsheet. Review the full MCP code if available, and compare
tool names to descriptions and code to identify any suspicious mismatches.
•
Monitor Tool Integrity and Version: Clients should pin the version of the MCP server and its tools at
the time of initial user approval. Use a hash or checksum to verify that tool descriptions and
functionality haven't been maliciously altered. Maintain a version history and alert administrators on
any unauthorized changes.
•
Runtime Policy Enforcement: Enforcing least-privilege policies at the MCP server boundary
(host/container/proxy)  to restrict tools from reading local files, accessing sensitive APIs, or
exfiltrating data.
Prompt Injection
Attackers craft malicious user inputs, content retrieved by tools or tool arguments to hijack the model's
context and force it to perform unintended actions, such as calling a dangerous tool, leaking conversation
history, or overriding safety policies.
Mitigations:

<!-- page 8 -->
genai.owasp.org
•
Validate Untrusted Data: Sanitize and validate all external data, such as tool descriptions and server
responses, and user inputs before passing it to the model. Refer to the Input Validation and
Sanitization section in the OWASP LLM Prompt Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet.
•
Use Strong Schemas: Define and enforce strict JSON/YAML schemas for all tool inputs. Use
libraries like Pydantic (Python) or JSON Schema for validation.
•
Segment Contexts: Segment client interactions with different users, and establish new
connections/sessions with third-party MCP servers for new or distinct operations.
Memory Poisoning
This attack corrupts an agent’s short-term or long-term memory (e.g., a vector database), causing it to store
false information, bypass security checks, or make flawed decisions. This can lead to systemic
misinformation or privilege escalation.
Mitigations:
•
Secure and Validate Memory: Enforce validation on every memory update. Scan for anomalies,
require source attribution, and use cryptographic hashes.
•
Limit Memory Retention: Implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) on stored data to prevent outdated or
malicious information from persisting.
•
Segment Memory: Prevent agents from writing to a shared memory store to avoid cascading
failures. Isolate memory by session or user identity.
Tool Interference
Using multiple MCP servers can lead to unintended tool execution chains. An LLM's output from one tool
might accidentally trigger a tool from another server, causing data leaks, accidental operations, or denial-of-
service loops.
Mitigations:
•
Require Human-in-the-Loop: For user-configurable servers, implement an acceptance flow before
executing a tool to ensure the user is aware of the action. For agentic systems, opt for a tiered HITL
strategy to enable robust oversight.
•
Separate Context: Isolate the context for each tool execution, passing only the necessary
information between them. Reset LLM context between distinct executions.
•
Set Timeouts: Implement execution timeouts to prevent poorly implemented or looping tools from
impacting the host.

Client Security and Server
Discovery

Understanding the distinct security responsibilities and attack surfaces of MCP clients and servers is crucial
for implementing comprehensive protection. Each side faces unique threats and requires tailored security
measures.

MCP Client Security Considerations
Clients are often embedded in applications. They act as consumers of tools and are the first line of defense
against malicious servers.
•
Trust Minimization: Do not assume servers are trustworthy; always validate manifests, enforce
schemas, and apply allowlists.
•
Sandbox Execution: Run clients in restricted environments (e.g., containers with limited
filesystem/network access) to reduce impact if a server is compromised.
•
Use Containers (e.g. Docker) to run third-party MCP servers. Docker containers provide a
standardized, isolated environment, preventing a compromised server from accessing the host
system's resources, files, or network.
•
Just-in-Time (JIT) Access: Grant tools temporary, narrowly scoped permissions only for the
duration of a specific task, with automatic expiration and instant revocation.
•
UI Transparency: Expose full tool descriptions, permissions, and data access to users before
execution. Avoid hidden or “summarized” views that mask risk.
•
Local Data Protection: Prevent servers from exfiltrating client-side secrets, history, or cached
memory. Sanitize any data passed into the LLM.
•
Incident Detection: Monitor for unusual tool invocation patterns (e.g., mass file reads, excessive API
calls) and trigger alerts.

Server discovery and verification
An important phase in using MCP servers is “discovery”, where servers are identified, verified, and
connected.
Discovery & Connection

<!-- page 10 -->
genai.owasp.org
•
Verify Origin Before Connecting: Only connect to servers from a trusted registry. Use IP allowlists
and network isolation to prevent connections to unknown servers. For open-source tools or locally
hosted servers, always verify the source, check signatures, and scan for known vulnerabilities or
malicious modifications.
•
Use Registry-Only Discovery: Maintain a central registry for all approved servers.
•
Choose the Hosting and Connection Paradigm:
o
STDIO (Local Connections): For locally hosted MCP servers (downloaded from a third-party
repository or vendor), utilize STDIO as a connection to an MCP server sub-process. This
approach offers the lowest latency and is easier to harden via process sandboxing,
seccomp, or AppArmor.
o
Streamable HTTP (Remote Connections): For remote, multi-tenant, or auto-scaling
servers, utilize a remote connection via Streamable HTTP. Use TLS/mTLS or OAuth 2.1 for
robust authentication, and protect with a WAF and rate limiters. Rotate credentials (API
keys, certs) regularly.
Verification
•
Pin Versions: Maintain a manifest of approved server and tool versions. Use checksums to verify
integrity and prevent silent, malicious upgrades.
•
Staged Rollout: First, enable new servers in a staging environment with full telemetry. Promote to
production only after a probation period with no incidents. Automate rollback procedures in case of
regression or compromise.
•
Record Human Approvals: Log all security and domain-owner approvals in the registry. Monitor and
alert on drift from the approved server inventory.

Authentication and Authorization
Authentication and authorization are both necessary for secure connections to MCP servers, locally or
remotely. MCP implements OAuth 2.1 as part of its specification, and can be used as a guide for
implementation, noting that different MCP architectures will require distinct OAuth setups.
Authentication
•
Utilize Client Credentials for system operations. In cases where MCP clients will interact as
systems with no user identity, authenticate to remote MCP servers using identity provider client
credentials.
•
Utilize OIDC/PKCE for user operations. For use cases with a user tightly connected to the
operation, like for chatbots or AI assistants, use OIDC and PKCE for user login, and utilize user
credentials for any authentication to downstream MCP servers.

<!-- page 11 -->
genai.owasp.org
o
Where OAuth cannot be implemented, use narrowly scoped and short-lived Personal Access
Tokens to identify and restrict user access.
•
Protected Registration. Dynamic Client Registration is not advised for most use cases. However, if
it is necessary, authorization servers that do not wish to provide unauthorized registration of clients
have several options to protect their registration endpoint.
o
Access Token: The server may require authorization (e.g., via OAuth access tokens) with
registration requests. Most often, this token can be requested manually outside of the
client registration flow.
o
Software Statements: Clients may provide a Software Statement, which is a signed JWT
asserting client metadata. Authorization servers may validate it to establish trust.
o
Signed Request Bodies: Servers may require registration requests to be signed and verify
signatures based on preconfigured keys.
Authorization
•
Define least-permission OAuth scopes: Restrict access to resources using OAuth scopes to ensure
MCP clients or users do not have excessive access.
•
Use granular permissions: Use action-level permissions on a per-identity basis to further limit
permissions to specific actions, or individual data elements.
•
Human-in-the-Loop controls: Require human-in-the-loop approval for actions that have not
previously been performed, like local MCP server access to the file system, or remote MCP execution
against new resources, like accessing emails.

genai.owasp.org
Governance

Establish a formal governance strategy to ensure only vetted and monitored MCP servers are used. The core
of this strategy is a trusted MCP registry.
The registry should hold metadata about each approved server and enforce policy at runtime. In this way, you
will be able to ensure only vetted, least-privileged, continuously monitored MCP servers are available to
hosts/agents, with policy-as-code gates and evidence for audit.

Governance Workflow
1.
Submission: A developer submits a new third-party MCP server for review with its documentation
and a hash of its tool descriptions.
2. Scanning: Automated security tools analyze the server (or code repository if available) for malware,
hidden instructions, and other risks.
3. Review & Sign-off: Security and domain experts review the scan results. Approved servers are
version-pinned and added to the registry.
4. Deployment & Monitoring: The server is deployed to staging and monitored. After a probation
period, it is promoted to production.
5. Periodic Re-validation: Servers are automatically re-scanned at regular intervals or when versions
change.
Recommended Roles & Responsibilities
•
Submitter (Developer): Proposes a new server integration and provides documentation.
•
Security Reviewer: Validates security controls, scans, and supply chain integrity.
•
Domain Owner: Confirms the server's functional necessity and approves scopes.
•
Approver: Security and domain owners must both sign off before a server is enabled.
•
Operator (SRE): Manages connection rollout, monitoring, and the kill-switch.
