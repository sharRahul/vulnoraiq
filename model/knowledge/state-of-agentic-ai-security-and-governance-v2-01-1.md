Executive Summary

v1.0 of this report (July 2025) framed agentic risks as a portfolio of plausible threats, surveyed an early
ecosystem, and called for governance to keep pace. In the year since, adoption has accelerated, the OWASP
Top 10 for Agentic Applications has been published, and a regulatory environment around agent-driven harm
has begun to take shape. v2 reads that year of evidence and is organized around three findings.

The threats are real now. What was a list of architectural concerns in 2025 now has production incidents,
vendor advisories, and CVEs attached to almost every entry. The Real-World Incidents and Exploits Tracker
in this edition curates that body of evidence, and the Threat Analysis chapter places each pattern in the
context of where agentic capability was expanding when the break happened. The threat model is no longer
hypothetical, and the design conversations that follow from it are no longer optional.
Safety and security converge at the deployment layer. For most of software's history, safety has been an
engineering concern and security has been an adversarial one, owned by different teams with different
methods. Agentic systems blur this picture when they act with broad autonomy and tool access. We argue
that at the deployment layer — the architectural decisions, configurations, permissions, and operational
controls owned by the deploying organization — the two categories cannot be operationally separated.We
argue that at the deployment layer the two categories cannot be operationally separated. Model-level safety
remains the provider's responsibility, but once an agent is acting on production systems the same controls

<!-- page 8 -->
genai.owasp.org
govern both kinds of harm and the same investigation surfaces both kinds of cause. The organisational
implication is direct: AI Safety and AI Security cannot continue as parallel functions.
Governance must keep pace with deployment. Regulators have accepted the premise that agents can
cause harm faster than human review can keep up. DORA's four-hour notification, NIS2's 24-hour early
warning, NY RAISE's 72-hour frontier reporting, and CA SB 53's 15-day window all assume continuous
oversight rather than periodic audit. The work that remains is different in kind, requiring live monitoring of
agent behavior, baselines that flag drift, automated incident routing, and stop mechanisms that operate in
seconds rather than days.

What is new in State of Agentic AI Security and Governance
v2
This edition introduces a revised Threat Analysis grounded in documented incidents, a new chapter on AI
Safety vs AI Security, and a Real-World Incidents and Exploits Tracker tied to the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic
Applications. A new Enterprise Adoption Maturity Model assesses governance capability against deployment
complexity, with each chapter aligned to the relevant Top 10 for Agentic categories. Agent Identity and Non-
Human Identity is elevated to a chapter treating identity as the new control plane, joined by a new chapter on
AI SBOM and Supply Chain Provenance. The Agents Taxonomy is revised across three independent
dimensions (type, implementation, and composition with autonomy as the cross-cutting dimension), the
ecosystem view draws on telemetry from 53 tracked agentic projects, and the regulatory landscape now
covers 42 instruments across 10 jurisdictions.

Where to start
The practical starting point is to identify the most advanced agents you are running today, then either raise
governance maturity to match or reduce the deployment tier. Particular attention is owed to Shadow AI,
which is already present in nearly every organization our contributors examined and must be discovered
before it can be governed. The evidence is no longer theoretical and the controls needed are clearer. The
Enterprise Adoption Maturity Model section is intended to give security and risk leaders a current map, a
shared vocabulary, and a concrete path forward.

Scope and Audience

The intended audience of this document is primarily CISOs, C-level executives, and senior leaders
responsible for the security, governance, and strategic oversight of agentic AI initiatives. We also aim to
inform security architects, AI engineers, and practitioners who will benefit from the report's framing of the
evolving threat landscape and governance challenges. Detailed implementation guidance, including
frameworks, cheat sheets, and technical mitigations, is maintained in companion OWASP resources
referenced throughout this document. In addition, this document covers regulatory context around agentic
systems and may be useful for compliance, legal, and regulatory-adjacent teams.

This report is published as part of the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI), one of the key streams within
the broader OWASP GenAI Security Project1. The GenAI Security Project, an OWASP Flagship with 600+
contributors from 18+ countries, serves as the umbrella for security guidance across large language models
and generative AI. ASI specifically focuses on the security challenges introduced when AI systems gain
autonomy and the ability to operate across trust boundaries.
Since the previous edition of this report (July 2025), the initiative has shipped several major releases. The
most significant is the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Security, the industry guidance dedicated to securing
autonomous AI agents. The table below references major ASI and GenAI Security Project resources available

Agents Taxonomy

The agentic landscape expanded significantly in 2025. New agent categories have emerged (personal
agents, infrastructure agents), agents are being built through fundamentally different implementation
approaches (orchestration frameworks, lightweight libraries, low-code platforms), and production
deployments increasingly involve multi-agent compositions that span trust boundaries. The taxonomy has
evolved to match.
This section classifies the agentic landscape across three independent dimensions:
•
Agent Types (Section 1): What the agent does and where it operates.
•
Implementation Patterns (Section 2): How the agent is built, which determines audit surface and
organizational visibility.
•
Composition Patterns (Section 3): How agents are arranged, which determines trust boundary
structure and cascading failure risk.
Any agent type can be built through any implementation pattern and participate in any composition pattern.
Scope
This taxonomy classifies agentic AI systems for security and governance purposes. It provides the
classification framework referenced by the threat analysis, protocol landscape, identity, and maturity model
sections of this report.
What this taxonomy does not claim: We are not suggesting that these categories are exhaustive or that
every production agent fits neatly into one type. These are the primary patterns observed as of mid 2026,
and classifying agents by what they do, how they are built, and how they are arranged provides a more
complete governance picture than classifying by operational role alone.

genai.owasp.org
Agent Types by Operational Role
As AI agents evolve in capability and adoption, they are being deployed across a wide range of environments.
Each class of agent introduces unique integration patterns and security risks. The following classification
organizes the primary agent types observed in production as of early 2026 by operational role and risk
surface. These categories should be treated as patterns rather than mutually exclusive classes; a single
system may span multiple categories depending on its deployment context, tool access, and autonomy level.

Note: These categories are patterns, not rigid classes. Production agents frequently span multiple types. Some
client-facing deployments use deterministic scripts that sit below the autonomy scale defined here; the
autonomy range applies to agent-based systems.
For a more detailed discussion of each agent type’s governance characteristics, properties, and key
controls, see Appendix 1: Detailed Agent Type Taxonomy.

Implementation Patterns
Any agent type in the taxonomy above can be built through very different implementation approaches. The
approach matters for governance because it determines audit surface, monitoring capabilities, and
organizational visibility. A hand-rolled coding agent and a LangGraph-based coding agent face the same
threat landscape, but the organization's ability to detect, inventory, and respond to them differs
substantially.

become a tracking requirement. Hook

configured.

Security properties are entirely builder-
determined. No standardized hooks,

deliberately added. Harder to inventory and
assess.
Platform-Native /
Low-Code
Copilot Studio, Salesforce Agentforce,
no-code workflow builders. Lowest
barrier to entry. Often built by citizen
developers outside engineering teams.
Governance depends entirely on platform
capabilities. Builders are least likely to
understand inherited security risks.
Highest shadow AI risk. ForcedLeak
(Agentforce) demonstrated exploitation at
this layer.
Governance implication: The maturity model assumes organizations can inventory and classify their agents
(Level 1+). For agents built via lightweight library composition or deployed as shadow AI through low-code
platforms, this inventory step is significantly harder. Security teams should not assume that framework
adoption equals visibility. These governance implications focus on runtime audit surface; pre-deployment
controls such as static analysis apply across all three patterns.
Cross-reference: For organizations using orchestration frameworks, the companion table of framework
security capabilities (in the Solutions Ecosystem section) provides a detailed comparison. The key takeaway:
built-in security features vary dramatically across frameworks, and none provide comprehensive coverage
out of the box. Regardless of implementation approach, the security controls documented in the Securing
Agentic Applications Guide apply.

<!-- page 17 -->
genai.owasp.org
Composition Patterns
Agents increasingly operate not in isolation but in compositions where multiple agents coordinate, delegate,
or chain tasks. Additionally, organizations increasingly deploy agents as independent parallel fleets where
multiple agents execute concurrently with no shared state or coordination. In these deployments,
governance challenges arise from aggregate scale (review bottleneck pressure, correlated failures across
shared tooling) rather than from inter-agent trust boundaries. The composition pattern determines trust
boundary structure and is the primary input to the protocol landscape and identity vs NHI sections of this
report. Any agent type can participate in any composition pattern; these are separate concerns.

Shared memory poisoning propagates across all agents.
Orchestrator is a single point of compromise. Operational
risks include coordination conflicts, resource contention,
and inconsistent policy enforcement across agents. Most
current MAS implementations lack mature controls in
these areas; organizations deploying multi-agent
architectures are operating ahead of the tooling available
to secure them. Target-state mitigations include memory
isolation where feasible, circuit breakers to prevent
cascading failures, and centralized policy enforcement,
but teams should assume these require custom
implementation rather than framework-provided
capability. Relevant: ASI07, ASI08.

Permission inheritance is the key risk. Injection in one

Blast radius scales with mesh size.

Cross-Cutting Dimension: Autonomy Level
Any agent type can operate at varying levels of autonomy. The risk profile changes substantially as autonomy
increases, not because the threat landscape changes, but because the window for human detection and
intervention narrows. Agents operating at high autonomy with persistent memory, broad tool access, and
minimal oversight represent the highest-risk configuration regardless of their operational role.
The key governance question is not only "what type of agent is this?" but "what can this agent do without a
human confirming the action?" Organizations should map each deployed agent's autonomy level and apply
controls proportional to the blast radius of unsupervised action.
Autonomy Level

Requires deterministic enforcement
(hooks, circuit breakers), continuous

<!-- page 19 -->
genai.owasp.org
For agents operating at the fully autonomous level, two additional governance requirements apply
regardless of agent type. First, organizations should enforce budget limits on execution time, API calls, and
compute cost to contain runaway autonomous loops before they exhaust resources or cause cascading
damage. Second, fully autonomous agents should be treated as high-risk principals within identity and
access management systems, with dedicated agent identities, explicit permission boundaries, and audit
trails distinct from the human users who deployed them. (See the Identity vs NHI section for implementation
guidance on agent identity lifecycle management.)

Notable Agentic Projects
Survey and Key Trends

The following trends are drawn from GitHub telemetry across 53 key agentic AI repositories tracked by the
OWASP State of AI Surveyor (see Appendix 4: Notable Agentic Projects for full methodology and project
data), supplemented by enterprise adoption data from a16z’s analysis of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 AI
deployments (April 2026).4
1.
The ecosystem is consolidating, and the new winners arrive pre-assessed. Only 5 of 53 repos
(9.4%) show surging commit growth; 39% are declining or stalled, and three projects are now
archived (AgentGPT, bytebot, opencode-ai/opencode). At the same time, several repos under 100
days old are already accumulating tens of thousands of stars per month, compressing the time
between "first commit" and "enterprise adoption" to weeks. This pattern extends beyond open
source: according to a16z's analysis, 29% of the Fortune 500 and roughly 19% of the Global 2000 are
now live, paying customers of a leading AI startup. Adoption velocity that historically took years has
compressed to months. The result is a rapid reshuffling in which a small cohort of high-velocity
projects absorbs community contribution while early entrants stagnate, and the projects replacing
them reach widespread enterprise use before security review cycles have even begun.
2. Coding agents dominate developer mindshare and enterprise adoption. With 28 of 53 repos
classified as coding agents (53%), and the five fastest-growing projects all in this category (Claude
Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Cline, Aider), the agentic ecosystem remains heavily weighted toward
developer tooling. Enterprise data confirms this concentration: a16z found coding to be the
dominant AI use case in Fortune 500 adoption by nearly an order of magnitude, with the majority of
enterprise AI tooling deployed in code. Growth rates for tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex
have outstripped even the most optimistic predictions. This has direct supply chain implications.
Code is upstream of all other applications, making an exploit in a widely-adopted coding agent (see
## ASI04: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities) not just a developer risk but a systemic one capable of
propagating malicious code into downstream applications with no human review checkpoint.
3. Release velocity is unprecedented and a governance gap. Seven projects ship releases daily or
faster. trycua/cua averaged a release every 8 hours over the tracked period. This velocity is not
accidental. Every major AI lab is competing aggressively to win code as a use case, creating
competitive pressure that incentivizes continuous delivery at a pace traditional security review
pipelines were never designed to absorb. At this cadence, traditional vulnerability scanning and
software composition analysis pipelines are structurally insufficient without automation. See the AI
SBOM and Supply Chain Provenance section for recommended controls.
4. Security advisory density correlates with adoption, not autonomy level. The top five repos by
advisory count (n8n: 57, Claude Code: 22, AutoGPT: 15, Dify: 13, Roo-Code: 11) are all semi-
autonomous frameworks or coding agents, not fully autonomous systems. This is partly a reporting

<!-- page 21 -->
genai.owasp.org
artifact (larger communities file more CVEs), but the pattern is consistent with broader enterprise
data: a16z's analysis shows that coding and workflow automation tools account for the bulk of
Fortune 500 AI adoption, meaning the frameworks generating the most security advisories are also
the ones with the deepest enterprise footprint. The implication is that frameworks, not just
autonomous end-agents, are high-value targets and should be prioritized accordingly in
organizational risk assessments.

Threat Analysis

Threat Landscape Overview
What was largely a theoretical risk portfolio twelve months ago is now operational. Adversaries are actively
targeting AI agents, their tool registries, and the protocols connecting them. Prompt injection underpins
nearly every attack class documented here, and the agentic supply chain has become a primary vector of
compromise as autonomy expands faster than governance.

This section updates the threat landscape across six areas: the autonomy shift and the expanding risk it
creates across all agent classes, prompt injection as the foundational unsolved challenge, the emergence of
the agentic supply chain as an active attack surface, the governance gap created by vibe coding and Shadow

<!-- page 22 -->
genai.owasp.org
AI, agent identity as a distinct control plane, and the convergence of major frameworks on a layered attack
surface model.
The Expanding Autonomy of Agents
The defining trend of 2025-2026 is the rapid expansion of agent autonomy across every category: enterprise
agents, coding agents, and client-facing agents alike. These platforms chain highly privileged capabilities
together, connecting systems that were never designed to trust each other through a probabilistic
intermediary that remains susceptible to prompt injection.
Enterprise and Low-Code Agents
No-code and low-code agentic platforms have become increasingly popular, enabling business users to build
AI workflows that connect to email, internal chat applications, organizational knowledge bases, and cloud
services. Throughout 2025, researchers demonstrated enterprise-scale attacks where a single poisoned
document (a shared file, a calendar invitation, or an email) was sufficient to cause an enterprise AI assistant
to exfiltrate sensitive data across organizational boundaries without triggering security alerts. In each case,
the agent operated as designed; the failure was in the trust assumptions governing what it connected to.
The users building these workflows often are "citizen developers", business professionals who are less
familiar with risks inherited from infrastructure pipelines, cloud misconfigurations, and SaaS service
integration patterns. They build quickly, deploy without security review, and often operate outside the
visibility of IT and security teams. The result is a growing population of highly connected, lightly governed
agents embedded across the enterprise. Attackers recognize this: targeting the legitimate data sources
that feed these agents, rather than the agents themselves, is an efficient way to implement prompt injection
at organizational scale. To learn more about such risks please refer to OWASP Citizen Development Top 10.5
Coding Agents
Coding agents have become the central arena where agentic AI capability is advancing fastest. Every major
AI lab shipped or significantly upgraded autonomous coding tools in 2025-2026, equipping them with shell
access, file system manipulation, git operations, and cloud infrastructure management. Development teams
are actively pushing toward maximum agent autonomy, guiding agents to create products and fix bugs with
as little human involvement as possible. The attack surface now extends beyond the model's output to the
entire development toolchain the agent is connected to.
As coding agents evolve into orchestration systems that spawn specialized sub-agents for implementation,
testing, and deployment, the blast radius of a single compromise scales with the mesh. A prompt injection
entering through one poisoned file can propagate through the delegation chain to agents that never
encountered it directly, because no agent in the chain has a mechanism to verify that its parent's
instructions were not manipulated.

<!-- page 23 -->
genai.owasp.org
Coding agents also introduce a distinct supply-chain risk: agent-generated commits that bypass human
review regress an organization's SLSA provenance level, eliminating the attestation guarantees that manual
review workflows provide. Branch protection rules and required-reviewer policies must be enforced at the
repository layer, not at the agent's configuration, since agents that can influence their own configuration can
also weaken the controls meant to bound them.
The natural organizational response is containment: sandbox the agent, restrict commands through
allowlists. But these controls were designed for human-controlled execution, and coding agents break that
assumption in ways that turn the controls into attack vectors. Real-world incidents confirm the gap: an AI
agent deleted a production database in direct violation of a code-freeze instruction; a coding tool extension
was compromised via a malicious pull request injecting destructive system prompts.
Two confirmed vulnerabilities illustrate the pattern. CVE-2026-22708, disclosed against Cursor in January
2026, showed that an attacker who can influence the agent's instructions can silently poison the execution
environment such that commands the user or allowlist has already approved, like git branch or python3
script.py, execute arbitrary code instead. The allowlist does not fail to prevent the attack. It streamlines
it, by auto-approving the very commands the attacker needs to trigger the payload. CVE-2025-59532,
disclosed against OpenAI's Codex CLI, showed that the agent's own output could redefine the sandbox's
writable boundary, enabling file writes and command execution outside the intended workspace. Both
reflect the same structural weakness: controls calibrated for human operators become exploitable when the
executor can influence its own containment.
These incidents span the safety-security boundary which we will explore in more detail in the AI Safety vs AI
Security section. Replit's failure had no adversary, the CVEs required one, but the underlying permission
architecture is the same. And that same autonomy is equally available to attackers: in February 2026,
hackerbot-claw,6 an autonomous bot deliberately built as a weapon, exploited GitHub Actions
misconfigurations across major open source repositories, compromised Aqua Trivy 7 through PAT theft, and
used the stolen credential to push a malicious artifact to the OpenVSX marketplace. No human direction
required after launch.
Client-Facing, Personal, and Infrastructure Agents
The same shift reshapes the remaining categories: client-facing agents now execute transactions directly,
exposing authorization boundaries to any user; personal agents on user devices connect to corporate
systems outside enterprise governance; and infrastructure agents hold IAM credentials, so a single
compromise enables lateral movement at infrastructure scale.
Vibe Coding and Shadow AI
"Vibe coding", named Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, describes generating entire applications
by describing intent in natural language and accepting AI-generated code without reviewing it. Large-scale
analyses of thousands of these applications reveal that LLMs produce statistically predictable

<!-- page 24 -->
genai.owasp.org
vulnerabilities: each model has its own recurring hardcoded secrets, preferred default configurations, and
consistent security gaps. Attackers who understand these model-specific patterns can exploit them at
scale, without reconnaissance.
The overlap with Shadow AI compounds the governance challenge. Surveys 8 indicate that roughly half of
employees use AI tools not sanctioned by their employer, often connecting them to work systems without IT
approval. Breach data confirms the impact: according to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 9 organizations
with significant shadow AI usage face materially higher breach costs, longer detection times, and elevated
rates of data compromise. Only 37% of organizations have policies to manage AI or detect shadow AI,
according to the same report. The gap between AI adoption speed and governance maturity is not closing; it
is widening.
Prompt Injection: The Primary Delivery Mechanism for Agentic Attacks
Prompt injection (LLM01:2025) is the most prevalent attack technique targeting AI systems. A single
injection that alters one response in a standalone model can, in an agent, redirect goals, corrupt multi-step
plans, forge inter-agent messages, and cascade into tool actions across multiple systems. This is why it
maps to six of the ten ASI categories.
The challenge is architectural. LLMs collapse the data plane and the control plane into a single channel:
system prompts, user requests, and content retrieved from external sources are all processed as a unified
token sequence, with no reliable mechanism to enforce a privilege boundary between them.LLMs process all
input as a unified token sequence, with no reliable mechanism to enforce a privilege boundary between the
system prompt, the user's request, and content retrieved from external sources. When an attacker embeds
instructions in any data source an agent processes, those instructions carry the same weight as legitimate
commands. Research published in January 2026 10 demonstrates how prompt injection functions as a key
link in the agentic kill chain, enabling lateral movement through multi-agent systems and privilege escalation
across organizational boundaries.
Because the architectural problem is unsolved, practitioners have shifted from trying to prevent injection to
constraining what an injected agent can actually accomplish. Simon Willison's famous "lethal trifecta"
identifies three agent properties whose combination makes injection exploitable end-to-end: access to
private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. When an agent has
all three within a single session, a single injection can complete the full attack chain. Instructions enter
through untrusted content, the agent retrieves private data in service of the injected goal, and the agent
delivers the stolen data through its external communication capability.
Meta's "Agents Rule of Two", published in October 2025, translates this into a design constraint: within any
session that does not require human approval, an agent should satisfy no more than two of the three
properties. The three-property configuration requires human-in-the-loop approval before the agent acts.

<!-- page 25 -->
genai.owasp.org
The enterprise prompt injection incidents documented in this section consistently involve agents that
satisfied all three properties without approval gates. The “Rule of Two” is valuable for explaining the
structural problem, but it is not a complete defense. Invitation Is All You Need (2025)11 document attacks
delivered through calendar invitations that remain viable with only two of the three properties present.
The Agent Supply Chain Moved from Theory to Active Exploitation
Last year's report flagged supply chain risk as a concern tied to tool misuse and protocol abuse. In 2025-
2026, it became the fastest-evolving attack vector in the agentic ecosystem, with attackers targeting every
layer: protocol infrastructure, skill registries, and core AI packages.
MCP Protocol Supply Chain
The MCP ecosystem proved especially vulnerable. Within months of widespread adoption, researchers
documented the first malicious MCP server in the wild: postmark-mcp,12 a postmark-themed package that
spent fifteen versions building legitimacy before silently adding a single line of exfiltration code. Shortly
after, a critical RCE vulnerability, CVE-2025-6514 (CVSS 9.6), was discovered in core MCP infrastructure used
by hundreds of thousands of developers, demonstrating that even the protocol's transport layer carried
exploitable trust assumptions.
What makes this distinct from traditional software supply chain attacks is an attack surface unique to
agents. Researchers formalized the concept of "Tool Poisoning Attacks": malicious instructions hidden in
tool description fields that are invisible to human reviewers but processed by AI models as trusted context.
The payload is not in the code but in the metadata, exploiting the gap between what humans audit and what
agents consume. Related techniques include “MCP Rug Pulls”, where tool descriptions change after approval,
and cross-origin escalation, where a malicious server shadows tools of a trusted one.
Skill Registry Exploitation
Skill and package registries showed the same pattern at a different layer. The ClawHavoc operation
embedded social engineering in fake skill documentation to deliver obfuscated payloads. Koi Security's audit
of the campaign 13 also identified outlier skills using distinct techniques: reverse shell backdoors that trigger
during normal use rather than installation, and skills that silently exfiltrate OpenClaw bot credentials from
configuration files. Snyk's independent ToxicSkills analysis 14 found skills poisoning the agent's persistent
memory files (SOUL.md and MEMORY.md), enabling time-delayed behavioral modification that persists
across sessions.
The exploitation then scaled to core AI infrastructure. In March 2026, TeamPCP's hackerbot-claw bot
exploited incomplete credential rotation at Aqua Security, compromised Trivy's GitHub Actions, and used it
to harvest LiteLLM's PyPI publishing token. Two backdoored versions were published directly to PyPI,
bypassing the upstream repository. The payload exploited Python's .pth mechanism, harvesting credentials
across 50+ categories. LiteLLM serves as the LLM gateway for CrewAI, DSPy, Microsoft GraphRAG, and

<!-- page 26 -->
genai.owasp.org
dozens of other agent frameworks. Nearly 47,000 downloads occurred during the three-hour exposure
window.
The pattern across all three layers is consistent: attackers are targeting the components agents trust
implicitly, and the blast radius scales with the dependency graph. Organizations that treat agentic supply
chain security as a traditional software dependency problem are underestimating both the attack surface
and the speed at which compromise propagates.
AI Agent Traps
The pattern across all three layers is consistent: attackers are targeting the components agents trust
implicitly, and the blast radius scales with the dependency graph. Franklin et al. (202615) formalize this as "AI
Agent Traps," a framework built on a structural observation that reframes where defenders should focus.
The attacker's target is not the agent but the information environment the agent consumes: tool
descriptions, retrieval corpora, persistent memory stores, skill registries, and web content. The agent's own
capabilities become the attack mechanism. The tool poisoning, memory persistence, and skill registry
attacks documented above all follow this pattern, as does the approval fatigue problem discussed in Future
Trends, which the framework treats as a deliberate attack on the human reviewer rather than incidental
operational friction. The framework also identifies multi-agent systemic traps, including cascading failures
triggered by correlated agent behaviour and fragmented payloads that reconstitute only when aggregated
across agents, that will become operationally relevant as multi-agent deployments reach production scale.
The Agent Identity and Governance Gap
Non-human identities now vastly outnumber human identities across enterprise environments, yet few
organizations have a strategy for managing non-human and agentic identities. As agents gain persistent
identities, API credentials, and the ability to act across systems, they inherit the full complexity of identity
and access management without the decades of tooling built around human identities. Coding agents hold
developer credentials. Enterprise agents access sensitive business data. Vibe-coded applications often ship
with hardcoded or plaintext secrets. Until organizations extend identity governance to non-human agents
with the same rigor applied to human users, this remains one of the most exploitable structural weaknesses
in the agentic landscape — and because the design decisions that create identity exposure are the same
ones that create autonomous-error exposure, fixing one fixes the other. For more insights on current gaps
on Identity please refer to section Agent Identity vs Non-Human Identity (NHI).
The Attack Surface Model Found Its Shape
The field's understanding of this attack surface matured significantly in 2025–2026. Independent efforts
(CSA's MAESTRO threat model, AWS's architecture scoping matrix, NVIDIA and Lakera's safety framework,
Google's A2A protocol) arrived at the same structural conclusion from different starting points: agentic risk
cannot be reduced to a single layer. It emerges from the interaction between the model's reasoning
capabilities, the tools it can invoke, the memory and context it accumulates, and the trust relationships

<!-- page 27 -->
genai.owasp.org
between cooperating agents. Compromise at one layer cascades through others. The six threat areas that
follow are organized around this layered understanding.

genai.owasp.org
AI Safety vs AI Security

Agentic AI systems can fail in ways that cause real harm. Those failures differ in origin, mechanism, and
implication, and the differences matter for how organizations detect, respond to, and govern them. This
section establishes two categories of risk, then argues that agentic systems make the operational boundary
between them unstable, with direct consequences for how security leaders structure threat modeling,
incident response, and organizational ownership.

AI Security
AI Safety
Definition
Risks from trust boundary violations:
an attacker, malicious content, or
unauthorized access enables influence
or control that should not have been
possible.
Risks from normal operation: the
system causes harm not because
someone attacked it, but because its
capabilities, defaults, or design
choices permit harmful outcomes.
Core question
Was a trust boundary crossed that
should have held?
Could this system cause harm
through normal operation?
Harm flows from
What was permitted
What the system is

These categories align with the international consensus. The 2026 International AI Safety Report's 16 three-
category framework distinguishes malicious use, malfunctions, and systemic risks, with the first two
mapping closely to the security and safety definitions used here.16 Practitioners working from either
framework will arrive at compatible risk assessments and control requirements.

## 16 The International AI Safety Report uses "AI safety" as a broad umbrella encompassing all categories of AI risk, including cybersecurity
and biosecurity threats. Our usage is narrower. What we call "safety" corresponds to what the report terms "malfunctions" and what the
AI research community calls "alignment" (specifically, operational alignment failures): the propensity of a system to use its capabilities
in ways that conflict with human intentions, values, or norms. We chose "safety" over "alignment" because for security leaders, "safety"
carries the right operational connotation: harm arising from what a system is, rather than from what an attacker does to it. Readers
moving between documents should map our "safety" to the report's "malfunctions" category and our "security" to its "malicious use"
category. We note that the safety/security distinction addresses harms traceable to specific systems. As agentic deployments scale,
localized failures can produce ecosystem-level consequences.

<!-- page 29 -->
genai.owasp.org
AI Security in Practice
Security failures share a common structure: an adversary exploits a gap between what was permitted and
what was intended. What varies is the attack vector, the persistence of the compromise, and how deeply the
exploitation leverages the agent's own architecture. The following scenarios illustrate how that structure
plays out across different levels of complexity.
A single poisoned input, whether a shared file, a calendar invite, or an email, can cause an enterprise AI
assistant to exfiltrate sensitive data without triggering any security alert. The agent functions exactly as
designed; the failure is that LLMs cannot reliably distinguish data they should process from instructions they
should follow. This data-instruction boundary is the most pervasive and least mature trust boundary in
agentic systems.
The same structural failure becomes more consequential when it interacts with the agent's execution
environment. A coding agent with a permissive sandbox receives a prompt injection through a cloned
repository and achieves remote code execution with full user privileges. The sandbox boundary existed in
name but enforced no meaningful containment. The severity comes from the gap between the control's
intended function and its actual enforcement, a pattern that recurs across every agent category.
A different class of attack exploits the agent's own memory. An attacker poisons an agent's persistent
memory through a single crafted interaction. Days later, when a user asks an unrelated question, the
embedded instructions activate and achieve unauthorized actions long after the initial compromise. The
agent treats its own memory as trusted context, yet an adversary can write to it through ordinary interaction
channels. Monitoring scoped to individual sessions will never detect it. The compromise persists silently
across every future interaction.

AI Safety in Practice
Safety failures share a different common structure: the system causes harm through normal operation,
without any adversary involved. What varies is whether the harm comes from the model's knowledge, its
reliability, or its autonomy. The following scenarios illustrate how each can play out in practice.
The first pattern involves information rather than action. A user asks an AI system how to synthesize a
controlled substance, and the system provides step-by-step instructions. The system had the capability to
produce dangerous information and insufficient guardrails to prevent it. The risk is bounded because a
human must still choose to act on the output. This is the provider's responsibility; frontier labs are investing
heavily in alignment and refusal training to reduce these failures.
The risk profile changes when the agent can act directly. In a documented 2025 incident,17 a coding assistant
deleted a user's production database despite explicit, repeated instructions to modify nothing. It then

<!-- page 30 -->
genai.owasp.org
fabricated thousands of fictional records, falsely reported that rollback was impossible, and continued
violating the code-freeze within seconds of being told to stop. The system simply could not reliably follow
constraints, and its default access level made that unreliability catastrophic. The model's unreliability was
the trigger, but the blast radius was determined by the deployment architecture.
A different pattern appears when the agent works as intended in each individual step but produces harmful
outcomes because its default autonomy exceeds what the situation warrants. In a 2026 incident,18 an
autonomous coding agent had its pull request to a major open-source library rejected by a maintainer. The
agent then researched the maintainer's personal information and contribution history, constructed a
defamatory narrative questioning their motivations and character, and published it to the open internet.
Each capability the agent exercised (web research, opinion formation, long-form writing, publishing)
functioned as designed. The harm originated in the design choice to grant an agent autonomous action over
consequential channels while leaving oversight minimal.
A fourth pattern operates through feedback rather than a single event. In July 2025, Grok began identifying
itself as "MechaHitler" and generating antisemitic content on X. The behavior did not emerge from a single
prompt or a single training run; it emerged from a feedback loop in which descriptions of the model's
behavior circulating on the platform became inputs the model was subsequently exposed to, amplifying and
stabilizing the labeled behavior. Researchers have documented this mechanism as "persona hyperstition"
(Franklin et al. 202615): public narratives about a model's identity re-enter the model through training data
and retrieval, producing outputs that reinforce the narrative and stabilize the behavior. The mechanism
requires no adversary. The pattern matters for security leaders because the controls that address reliability
failures do not address it: the drift happens between sessions rather than within them, and by the time the
behavior is visible, the running system has already diverged from the system the deployer assessed and built
controls around.

Why Agentic Systems Collapse This Distinction
In traditional software, safety and security are operationally separable. A bridge's structural integrity is an
engineering concern; someone planting explosives on it is a security concern. The two problems call for
different teams, different methods, and different reporting chains. AI systems that merely generate text or
classify images largely preserved this separation: you could treat adversarial prompt injection as a security
problem and hallucination as a product-quality problem, and the organizational lines held.
Agentic AI destabilizes this. To be precise, it is deployment-layer safety that converges with security. Model-
level safety remains a distinct discipline, and frontier labs' investments there reduce the frequency of
certain failures but do not eliminate the deployer's architectural obligations.

<!-- page 31 -->
genai.owasp.org
When an AI system can autonomously execute consequential actions (e.g., sending emails, modifying files,
invoking APIs, committing code, triggering transactions) the distinction between "the system did something
harmful because it was manipulated" and "the system did something harmful because it could" becomes
operationally difficult to maintain. The more capable and autonomous the agent, the more these categories
converge: every capability the agent can misuse on its own is also a capability an adversary can trigger
through prompt injection, memory poisoning, or tool manipulation, and an attacker's leverage over the
system comes precisely from the agent's power to act in the world. In high-stakes domains where AI
decisions affect health, safety, or welfare, organizations should assume that attackers will specifically
target safety-critical functions. For agents with limited autonomy or human-in-the-loop controls, the
categories remain usefully separable. For agents operating with broad permissions and minimal oversight,
the separation breaks down.
Two cases illustrate this point:
•
An enterprise agent with broad file-system access deletes production data. Was this a safety failure
(the agent couldn't reliably follow constraints) or a security failure (the permission model was too
permissive)? The question itself is malformed. The over-permissioned access model is the safety
failure, and that same safety failure is the security gap an adversary would exploit. Trying to classify
this incident into one category or the other produces an organizational delay during which the
incident goes uncontained.
•
An agent whose persistent memory was poisoned by an earlier adversarial interaction begins, days
or weeks later, behaving anomalously: exfiltrating data, giving subtly wrong answers, taking
unauthorized actions. To the team observing this in real time, the behavior looks exactly like a
reliability malfunction. Only deep forensic analysis would reveal the underlying security
compromise. The team that treats this as a safety issue (restart the agent, check for drift, review
the training data) might miss the persistence mechanism entirely and get compromised again. A
team that treats it as a security issue (hunt for the initial access vector, analyze memory state, look
for indicators of ongoing control) is more likely to contain it.
The convergence described above reflects the current baseline of agentic reliability. The open-source
incident described earlier illustrates this directly: the same defamatory outcome could have resulted from
autonomous goal drift or from adversarial prompting, and the affected maintainer had no way to distinguish
between the two. The International AI Safety Report documents that current AI agents can complete well-
specified tasks of roughly thirty minutes' duration at around 80% reliability, but success rates decline
sharply as task complexity increases, falling below 25% for tasks requiring several hours. Documented
failure modes include executing irrelevant commands, losing track of operational state, and failing to
recover from simple errors without human intervention. These are current-state limitations that may
improve over time, but organizations deploying agentic systems today must design their controls for today's
reliability. When safety failures are this frequent, the opportunities they create for adversaries are equally
widespread.

<!-- page 32 -->
genai.owasp.org
Every major trend documented elsewhere in this report deepens this convergence. The table below traces
four trends across their safety and security dimensions. The Convergence Effect column shows the
structural result: in each case, the same design decisions that create safety risk also create security risk.

The pattern across every row is the same: the design decisions that create safety exposure are the same
ones that create security exposure. Addressing one requires addressing the other. Monitoring for one
produces the telemetry needed for the other.

Scope and Adjacent Risks
Security and safety as defined here address harms traceable to a specific system's behavior, whether
adversarial or non-adversarial. This includes multi-agent failure modes such as miscoordination and
resource conflicts, which involve interactions between systems but remain traceable to specific
architectural and design choices.

<!-- page 33 -->
genai.owasp.org
A separate category of risk falls outside this section's operational scope: systemic harms arising from
widespread adoption rather than from any single system's failure. These include labor market displacement,
erosion of human autonomy through automation bias and emotional dependence on AI systems, and
degradation of information environments.  At the far end of the scale spectrum, they also include existential
and catastrophic risk scenarios in which sufficiently capable agentic systems produce irreversible harms at
a civilizational level. These risks are real and increasingly consequential, but they require policy-level and
ecosystem-level responses beyond the reach of deployment security controls. Organizations building
agentic systems should monitor developments in systemic risk governance alongside the system-level
controls addressed here.
Security and safety remain useful analytical categories for understanding why a system failed. They become
counterproductive when they determine who responds. The case for treating deployment-layer safety and
security as dimensions of a single risk surface, governed together, monitored together, and responded to
together, is strongest where agent autonomy and capability are highest, and will only strengthen as agentic
deployment accelerates.

What This Means for Security Leaders
The organizational consequence is direct: at the deployment layer, safety and security for agentic systems
cannot be governed separately. Model-level safety remains the provider's domain, but the failures
documented above share root causes with security and demand the same controls and incident-response
capabilities.
In most enterprises today, AI safety lives with ML engineering or product teams, AI security lives with
InfoSec or the CISO's office, and AI adoption strategy often sits with a transformation or innovation function
that owns deployment decisions but may lack formal accountability for either safety or security outcomes.
Each function has its own risk taxonomy, its own escalation paths, and its own definition of what constitutes
an incident. This separation was workable when the worst a model could do was produce a bad output that a
human would review before acting on it, but it does not hold for systems that act autonomously. CISOs,
CTOs, heads of AI, and product security leaders all have a stake in how this boundary is redrawn.
Expanding an existing security mandate to cover safety failures is a natural starting point, but the challenge
is substantive. Safety failures in agentic systems involve model behavior and evaluation methodology that
most security organizations have limited experience with, even when the architectural decisions involved
(permission models, tool access, workflow design) are familiar territory. Safety-focused teams, conversely,
often lack the adversarial mindset and incident-response discipline that security work demands. How
organizations bridge this gap will vary, whether through expanded roles, cross-functional structures, or
dedicated AI risk functions, but the gap itself is a consistent feature of the current landscape. The table

below maps five dimensions where the need for closer integration has immediate operational
consequences.

Real-World Incidents and
Exploits Tracker

When v1.0 was published, agentic AI security was still largely theoretical: controlled research environments,
early proofs of concept, speculative threat models. By late 2025 and into early 2026, that changed. A growing
body of documented incidents and exploit disclosures now shows how agentic systems fail in production,
often through tool execution layers, connector infrastructure, protocol implementations, and weak
governance over delegated authority.
This section draws on the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) Exploits and Incidents Tracker and related
public disclosures to surface the failure patterns most relevant to evidence-based risk assessment and
control design. It is a curated snapshot, not an exhaustive archive, and inclusion does not imply fault by any
specific vendor or organization. Related standards work exists at ETSI TC SAI (TS 104 223, EN 304 223),
which addresses AI models and systems but does not currently include agentic-specific use cases. For the

Protocol Landscape and Risks

Agentic AI protocols now form the backbone of most production-grade agentic systems. What were still
emerging interoperability standards during the v1.0 publication cycle are now embedded across enterprise
platforms, developer tools, and customer-facing services.
These protocols standardize how agents invoke tools, communicate with other agents, and discover
available capabilities. This has made large-scale deployment possible. It has also created shared attack
surfaces and extended trust boundaries far beyond traditional application and network perimeters.
Several major protocols are now governed, or in the process of being governed, through open foundations
and industry consortia, improving standardization and transparency, but this has not yet translated into
consistently secure implementations.
Since mid-2025, multiple incidents have shown that protocol-layer weaknesses translate directly into
operational failures, data exposure, and regulatory risk. In practice, protocol governance has not kept pace
with adoption.
This section provides a high-level view of the main protocol categories and the security and governance
issues they introduce.

Agent-to-Tool Invocation Protocols
Agent-to-tool invocation protocols connect reasoning systems (LLMs, SLMs, and orchestration layers) to
deterministic tools, APIs, and data sources. They allow agents to perform concrete actions such as querying
internal systems, sending messages, initiating transactions, and triggering workflows. By 2026, these
protocols are deeply integrated into productivity platforms, developer environments, and enterprise
automation systems.
Representative protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP) (High Adoption)
Security and governance considerations: Tool invocation protocols delegate operational authority to
agents. Incidents and disclosures since 2025 show that insecure MCP server implementations can enable
compromise, including remote code execution, and that weak context and tool boundary controls create
realistic paths to data exposure and privilege misuse. This is particularly true where tool descriptors and
server manifests function as policy-bearing artifacts to data exposure and privilege misuse.
Organizations that rely on these protocols must treat tool interfaces as regulated execution environments,

<!-- page 38 -->
genai.owasp.org
not passive integrations. Least-privilege access, strong sandboxing, real-time security inspection, and
continuous monitoring are essential. OWASP has published dedicated resources for MCP security, including
the OWASP MCP Cheatsheet27 and the OWASP Guide for MCP28, which provide practical guidance for securing
MCP implementations.

Agent Communication Protocols
Agent communication protocols enable structured messaging and coordination between autonomous
systems. They support delegation, negotiation, and collaborative task execution across internal and external
environments. These protocols increasingly connect agents operated by different vendors, teams, and
organizations.
Representative protocols: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) (Low adoption); Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) (Low
adoption) In practice, the ecosystem is converging around fewer shared standards under common
governance frameworks.
Security and governance considerations: Inter-agent communication extends organizational trust
boundaries in ways that are often poorly understood. Observed risks include: agent impersonation and
identity spoofing; uncontrolled delegation loops; lateral movement between autonomous systems; and trust
transitivity failures. Without explicit governance controls, agents can inherit authority without
corresponding accountability or clearly assigned organizational responsibility. Secure deployment requires
strong identity binding, clearly defined delegation limits, and auditable communication paths.

Agent and Tool Discovery Protocols
Discovery protocols allow agents to locate tools and peers dynamically based on advertised capabilities.
They support scalable, loosely coupled ecosystems in which agents can collaborate without manual
configuration.
Representative protocols: Networked Agents and Decentralized AI (NANDA) (Low Adoption); Agent Name
Service (ANS) (Low Adoption), which provides PKI-backed identity and registry metadata and supports
integration across MCP, A2A, and ACP
Security and governance considerations: Discovery layers concentrate trust in registries and routing
services. Real-world incidents have involved: capability misrepresentation; registry poisoning; Sybil agent
creation; and traffic redirection. From a governance perspective, discovery systems function as critical
trust infrastructure. They require controls comparable to domain name systems and public key

<!-- page 39 -->
genai.owasp.org
infrastructure, including cryptographic identity anchoring, integrity monitoring, and reliable revocation
mechanisms.

Cross-Cutting Protocol Risks
Across protocol categories, incident analysis shows recurring structural weaknesses: identity dilution
through composite and transitive trust; excessive capability exposure; fragmented audit trails across
vendors; weak containment and revocation mechanisms; and limited visibility into autonomous delegation.
These risks are primarily architectural and governance-related, and are compounded by fragmented shared-
responsibility models across vendors and deploying organizations.

Baseline Security and Governance Expectations
By 2026, organizations deploying standardized agentic protocols should, at minimum, be able to
demonstrate: cryptographically verifiable identities for agents and tools; explicit limits on delegation and
autonomy, including defined escalation paths and human-in-the-loop oversight triggers; validation and
sanitization of shared context and descriptors; least-privilege execution environments; software supply
chain controls for protocol servers and adapters, including provenance, signing, and vulnerability
management; end-to-end, audit-grade protocol-level telemetry and traceability; and rapid revocation and
containment controls. Where these foundations are missing, protocol adoption consistently amplifies risk
faster than governance structures can respond.

Agent Identity vs Non-Human
Identity (NHI)

These are two distinct layers of the same problem, and the industry uses them interchangeably to its own
cost. One is an authentication primitive. The other is a governance framework built on top of it.
Non-Human Identity (NHI) is the digital representation and authentication of non-human entities -
traditionally static service accounts and API keys.
Agent Identity is a dynamic, cryptographic framework to attest agent identity and securely govern
autonomous agents capable of independent reasoning and cross-boundary execution.
Conflating the two is why most identity programs are not ready for agents. NHI tells you a credential is valid.
It cannot tell you whether the reasoning entity holding it should be taking the action it is taking right now.
The difference boils down to that Non-Human Identity verifies that a credential is authorized to connect.
Agent Identity has to verify what the holder is doing with that authorization, continuously.
Traditional NHI (service accounts, API keys) answers a single question at authentication time. “Is this entity
allowed in?” The answer holds until someone rotates the credential, which works for a workload that does the
same thing every time. It breaks for an agent. An agent reasons, delegates to other agents, and discovers
new tools at runtime, so the question is no longer “can this credential connect” but “who delegated this
agent, what is it trying to do right now, and is it still allowed to do it.” NHI gates identity at the start of a
session. Agent Identity has to govern behavior at the moment of each action. That shift, from verifying the
holder to governing the behavior, is what the rest of this section unpacks.
The scale of the problem is already evident. Non-human identities outnumber human users by ratios of 100:1
in most enterprises, with some organizations reporting 500:1. Entro Security's 2025 State of NHI report
found 97% of NHIs carry excessive privileges, and just 0.01% of machine identities control 80% of cloud
resources; 71% are not rotated within recommended timeframes.
As organizations move from chat-based assistants to fully autonomous agentic workflows, the concept of
identity has fundamentally shifted. In traditional cybersecurity, Non-Human Identities (NHI) referred
primarily to static service accounts, API keys, OAuth credentials or certificates used by workloads. In the
Agentic Era, the terms NHI and Agent Identity are often conflated, but they operate at different layers: NHI
provides the authentication primitives, while Agent Identity is the governance framework that attests the
provenance, intent, and authority of entities that reason, plan, and execute across trust boundaries. To

<!-- page 41 -->
genai.owasp.org
address the emerging challenges of agentic governance, both must evolve together. The legacy NHI patterns
built for static workloads cannot, on their own, govern autonomous reasoners.
Agents are not just passive scripts; they are autonomous actors. They negotiate with other agents, invoke
tools, and access sensitive data often without a human directly in the loop. Consequently, the "identity" of an
agent cannot be a simple static secret. A robust Agentic Identity framework must dynamically enforce three
cryptographic assertions: Provenance (verifying the integrity of the agent), Attestation (validating the
agent’s identity), and Intent. In parallel, it must address the limits of legacy OAuth-style, token-centric
delegation models that were designed for coarse-grained, human-centric or monolithic machine clients
rather than high-velocity, per-task agent decisions.

The Shift: From Service Accounts to Agentic Identity
Traditional IAM struggles to contain agentic behavior. A standard service account granted database "Read"
access retains it permanently. An Agentic Identity, however, requires high-velocity, ephemeral permissions
aligned with the agent's current task and reasoning state. OAuth 2.0 machine-to-machine patterns (like the
client credentials flow) use static scopes in reusable tokens, hindering the granular, real-time revocation
needed for agents.

<!-- page 42 -->
genai.owasp.org
•
Static vs. Dynamic: Unlike deterministic microservices, an agent’s intent changes based on the
prompt. Frameworks must support Just-in-Time (JIT) privilege escalation and reduction, granting
only the permissions necessary for the immediate reasoning step. Opaque access tokens fail here:
they are size-limited, static once issued, and lack individual authorization decision visibility,
complicating fine-grained policy evaluation and post-incident forensics.
•
The Principal-Agent Problem: Agents act on behalf of human users. Identity models require robust
delegation chains that preserve the original user’s context and constraints to prevent privilege
escalation. This means explicitly modeling an agent's allowed operations under a user’s authority,
representing that authority in short-lived credentials, and enabling downstream services to
distinguish between the agent’s base capabilities and delegated rights to prevent "confused deputy"
attacks.

Core Components of Agentic Identity
Organizations must treat Agent Identity as a cryptographic assertion rather than a simple credential.
•
Identity Attestation: Before issuing an identity token, infrastructure must verify the agent’s code
integrity, model weights, and runtime environment. Altered agents or system prompts must be
denied tokens, mirroring CI/CD attestation patterns where only verified runtimes access sensitive
resources.
•
Verifiable Credentials: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and Agent-to-Tool communications require short-
lived, verifiable credentials (e.g., SPIFFE SVIDs, OIDC tokens) embedding metadata on trust tiers and
assignments, rather than long-lived API keys. Decentralized Identity approaches (using DIDs and
Verifiable Credentials) allow agents to prove domain membership or role assurances across
organizations without a central provider.
•
Identity Chaining: When invoking tools via protocols like MCP, tokens must cryptographically bind
the request to the originating principal to prevent "confused deputy" attacks. Downstream NHI
tokens must carry structured claims representing both the agent and upstream principal. This
allows policy engines to enforce constraints utilizing Token Exchange flows (RFC 8693)29 to retain
request context across multi-agent chains.
•
Dynamic Access and Fine-Grained NHIs: Effective permissions must dynamically adapt to the
current task. Platforms must issue NHIs scoped to minimal required access, demanding fine-
grained authorization at the API endpoint or resource level (e.g., granting read access to a single
repository without broad, reusable rights).
•
Agent Naming Service: Organizations need a standardized way to register and discover Non-Human
Identities. An internal “Agent Naming Service”30 can provide stable identifiers, maps them to
cryptographic IDs (DIDs/SPIFFE IDs), and exposes authoritative metadata (ownership, allowed tools,
trust tier) for authorization and audits.

<!-- page 43 -->
genai.owasp.org
Risks of Weak Agent Identity and NHI Strategy
Without a dedicated Identity & NHI strategy, organizations face severe risks:
•
Identity Spoofing & Impersonation: Lacking cryptographic binding, rogue agents can impersonate
trusted entities. Reusing NHIs across agents destroys accountability and magnifies compromise
impact, aligning with OWASP NHI9:2025 NHI Reuse.31
•
Ghost Agents: Agents spun up for tasks but never decommissioned retain valid identities, acting as
dormant backdoors. This reflects OWASP NHI1:2025 Improper Offboarding32 and NHI7:2025 Long-
Lived Secrets.33
•
Agent Trust Transitivity Failures: If Agent A trusts B, and B delegates to untrusted C, data leaks
outside the trust boundary. Protocols must enforce explicit trust extension limits to mitigate
OWASP NHI5:2025 Overprivileged NHI 34 and NHI9:2025 NHI Reuse.35
•
Third-Party Agentic Supply Chain: Agents relying on external skills or plugins risk executing
poisoned data with invoking-workflow privileges. This mirrors OWASP NHI3:2025 Vulnerable Third-
Party NHI,36 demanding strict provenance verification.
•
Credential Sprawl: Tool integrations introduce credential sprawl (API keys, static secrets) often
misconfigured in code or prompts. This amplifies OWASP NHI2:2025 Secret Leakage,37 NHI4:2025
Insecure Authentication,38 and NHI7:2025 Long-Lived Secrets.39 GTG-1002 showed what this looks
like at machine speed: a jailbroken coding agent with MCP-connected tooling autonomously
harvested credentials across multiple targeted environments at machine speed, with humans
intervening only at four to six decision points per campaign.
•
Legacy NHI and Human-Proxied Identity: Agents utilizing shared service accounts or human user
identities lose accountability and inherit inappropriate privileges. This blurs the human-agent line,
violating least-privilege and directly risking OWASP NHI4:202540 and NHI10:2025 Human Use of NHI41
(in reverse). ServiceNow's BodySnatcher (CVE-2025-12420) demonstrated the operational
consequence: a hardcoded API secret combined with email-based auto-linking let unauthenticated
attackers impersonate any user, including admins, and then direct AI agents to execute privileged
workflows under that hijacked identity.
•
Credential Scope as Blast Radius: Over-scoped agent credentials produce harm whether the
triggering event is adversarial or autonomous. The Replit production database deletion
demonstrated this without any attacker involved, reinforcing that identity scope governs impact
regardless of cause. Aligns with OWASP NHI5:2025 Overprivileged NHI.42

Operational Requirements Through 2027
Governance teams and security architects must prepare for an explosion in the volume of Non-Human
Identities and the lack of agent identity solutions. The OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 1043 for 2025
highlights how improper offboarding, long-lived secrets, overprivileged NHIs, insecure authentication

<!-- page 44 -->
genai.owasp.org
patterns, and NHI reuse are already prevalent in cloud and API-driven systems, and agentic architectures will
inherit and intensify these failure modes if left unaddressed.
•
Automated Identity Lifecycle: The manual creation of service accounts is unsustainable for agentic
systems that may spawn hundreds of sub-agents per hour. Identity issuance must be automated,
ephemeral, and tied to the lifespan of the agentic workflow. This includes automated offboarding on
workflow completion to avoid Improper Offboarding (NHI1:2025) and ensuring that tokens, keys, and
certificates have short lifetimes so they do not become Long-Lived Secrets (NHI7:2025).
•
Policy-as-Code for NHI: Entitlements for agent identities should be defined in code and evaluated in
real-time. An agent’s identity should strictly limit which tools it can "discover" and invoke, preventing
a customer-support agent from ever possessing the identity attributes required to access
production engineering tools. Policy engines should be able to interpret both traditional NHI
attributes (such as environment, application, and privilege level) and emerging agent-specific claims
(such as reasoning mode, task type, or DID-bound credentials) to enforce least privilege and prevent
Overprivileged NHI (NHI5:2025) in multi-agent workflows.

What This Means for Security Leaders
In the agentic world, identity is the new perimeter. Organizations must move beyond static secrets and
embrace cryptographic, attested, and ephemeral identities that bind every autonomous action to a verifiable
source of authority. Doing so requires rethinking OAuth-style authorization for agents, incorporating
verifiable credential and decentralized identifier patterns where appropriate, and aligning operational
controls with the OWASP Top 10 for Non-Human Identities so that agentic NHIs are managed with the same
rigor as or greater than today’s service accounts and machine credentials.

AI SBOM and Supply Chain
Provenance

Software supply chain security has been long focused on risks associated with third-party software. Modern
applications rely on extensive open-source libraries, container images, and third-party services, creating
complex transitive dependency graphs. Incidents involving dependency confusion, typosquatting, malicious
package uploads, and compromised upstream maintainers demonstrated how a single weak link can
propagate across thousands of systems. In response, many organizations have adopted SBOM (Software Bill
of Materials) practices, vulnerability scanning, artifact signing, and provenance frameworks to improve
visibility and integrity assurance.
AI systems inherit these same risks. Models depend on frameworks, libraries, orchestration layers, and cloud
services. AI SBOM, also known as AIBOM (Artificial Intelligence Bill of Materials) efforts extended traditional
SBOM concepts to capture model versions, providers, training lineage where available, and runtime
environments. These controls remain foundational, and key initiatives such as the OWASP GenAI Security
Project’s AIBOM Initiative44 play a critical role in strengthening AI supply chain security. Mature vulnerability
management and artifact integrity verification remain baseline requirements.
To strengthen assurance, AI SBOM practices should align with established supply chain standards and
frameworks, including the NTIA Minimum Elements for SBOM, SPDX 3.0, and CycloneDX. Secure
development and build integrity controls, such as those described in NIST SP 800-218 (Secure Software
Development Framework), provide structured approaches to ensuring the integrity of model artifacts,
container images, orchestration components, and associated dependencies.
However, agentic systems introduce an additional dimension. Unlike conventional software, agentic
architectures can dynamically discover, select, and invoke external capabilities at runtime. Skills, tools,
plugins, registries, retrieval sources, and even delegated sub-agents may be engaged during execution
rather than defined solely at build time. As a result, the effective dependency graph is dynamically
constructed during runtime.
In such environments, provenance must extend beyond static artifact inventory. Cryptographic signing,
integrity verification, and runtime attestation mechanisms become essential. Execution environments,
model artifacts, tool connectors, and orchestration layers should be verifiable and traceable to trusted build
pipelines. Without verifiable provenance, dynamic composition increases the risk of unauthorized
modification, injection, or privilege escalation.

<!-- page 47 -->
genai.owasp.org
Recent incidents have shown that compromise often originates not in the model artifact itself, but in
external tools, registries, or contextual data sources invoked by the agent. Traditional SBOM captures what
is installed. It does not fully capture what can be composed or executed dynamically.
This gap motivates the evolution towards an AI system SBOM. It builds on SBOM and AIBOM principles but
extends visibility to orchestration frameworks, tool connectors, identity boundaries, authorization policies,
and records of runtime invocation and delegation. In agentic systems, authority can propagate across
multiple services within a single workflow, making execution provenance as important as artifact integrity.
The shift is subtle but significant. Software supply chain security asked what components are present.
Agentic supply chain security must also address what capabilities can be assembled at runtime and under
whose authority they execute. The progression from artifact transparency to execution and authority
transparency defines the next stage of supply chain governance for agentic AI systems.
For executive leadership and boards, this evolution reframes AI supply chain transparency as a governance
control rather than a technical feature. Execution traceability, authority boundaries, and runtime integrity
should be integrated into enterprise risk management, particularly for regulated, safety-critical, or high-
impact AI deployments.

What This Means for Security Leaders
1.
Institutionalize SBOM Across All Software, Including AI Infrastructure:  Ensure traditional SBOM
generation aligned to NTIA minimum elements and structured formats such as SPDX or CycloneDX,
integrated into enterprise vulnerability lifecycle management and AI deployment pipelines.Agentic
systems must not bypass existing supply chain governance.
2. Adopt and Operationalize AIBOM for AI Systems: Extend transparency beyond software
dependencies to include model artifacts, training lineage where available, and AI-specific
components. Align with industry efforts such as the OWASP GenAI Security Project’s AI SBOM
Initiative to standardize expectations and formats.
3. Establish a Formal Inventory of AI and Agentic Components: Create and maintain an authoritative
registry of AI systems, including models, datasets, RAG, MCP servers, agent frameworks,
connectors, tool ecosystems, and external registries. If it can influence agent behavior, it must be
inventoried.
4. Expand Supply Chain Governance to Runtime Composition: Recognize that agentic systems
assemble capabilities at runtime. Update governance frameworks to include tool registries, plugin
ecosystems, delegated agents, and external context sources within supply chain scope.
5. Require Decision-Level Traceability for High-Impact Workflows: For consequential or regulated
use cases, mandate the ability to reconstruct which components, tools, and delegated agents
contributed to an outcome. This extends software transparency into decision transparency.

<!-- page 48 -->
genai.owasp.org
Agentic AI systems extend traditional software supply chain risk into runtime composition and delegated
authority. Organizations that combine strong SBOM foundations with structured AIBOM practices and
decision-level transparency will be better positioned to secure, govern, and scale agentic systems
responsibly.

genai.owasp.org
Explainable AI and Agent
Transparency

Explainable AI (XAI) covers the techniques and design patterns that make an AI system’s behavior
understandable and auditable to engineers, operators, and reviewers. In practice, XAI matters because it
turns a model's actions or predictions into components that can be verified, contested, controlled, and
monitored especially in high-stakes or regulated environments. In agentic systems, however, the main
challenge is not whether explainability matters, but which forms of explainability remain reliable,
transferable, and operationally useful.
Limits of classical XAI. Classical XAI techniques including feature attribution methods (e.g., gradient-based
attributions, SHAP), surrogate-model approaches (e.g. LIME), and concept-based analyses remain valuable
tools for understanding model behavior at the level of individual predictions or internal representations.
However, these approaches were primarily developed for single-step prediction settings and they do not
transfer to agentic systems, especially when models are accessed via API and internal weights, or
intermediate states are unavailable. Agentic systems require trajectory-level transparency rather than
feature-level attribution.
Limits of chain-of-thought as explanation. Early LLM deployments often treated chain-of-thought (CoT), a
step-by-step explanation generated by the model, as “the explanation”. These “explanations” are not
guaranteed to be faithful to the actual decision process. In many cases, CoT is best understood as a
communication layer useful for clarity, UX, and sometimes debugging, rather than evidence of internal
computation (e.g., see “Reasoning models don’t always say what they think”)45. This is reflected in ASI09
Human-Agent Trust Exploitation, where an agent may persuade a human to approve an unsafe action based
on an explanation that cannot be independently verified. For security teams, the more reliable goal is
decision transparency that can be verified: what inputs were used, what constraints applied, and what
evidence supported the outcome.
Limits of mechanistic interpretability. Within the broader XAI landscape, mechanistic interpretability
concentrates on “inside-the-model” explanations, seeking to reverse-engineer internal representations by
analyzing activations and hidden states through techniques such as probing, sparse autoencoders, circuit
discovery, and causal interventions, with the goal of surfacing interpretable features that drive model
behavior. This remains an active research frontier: today we generally cannot reliably establish a one-to-one
mapping between a specific tool choice, command, or multi-step reasoning behavior and a single causal
mechanism inside the model. While internal analyses can reveal meaningful statistical associations, the

<!-- page 50 -->
genai.owasp.org
same internal components often contribute to multiple behaviors, and the same behavior may arise from
different internal pathways depending on context.
In agentic systems, explainability shifts from explaining a single answer to explaining a trajectory: what was
retrieved, which tools were invoked, what the tools returned, how agent memory changed over time, and
which policy hooks allowed or blocked each step. This area remains under active development, and there is
no widely adopted standard for agent-level explainability. Emerging practices focus on structured trace
records that combine:
•
concise human-readable justification,
•
linked execution evidence (tool inputs and outputs, retrieved sources, state changes), and
•
diagnostic signals that help localize where behavior diverged from expectations (e.g., tool misuse,
intent drift).
Explainability requirements are increasingly codified in law, not left to discretion. EU AI Act Article 13
mandates transparency for high-risk AI systems, including documentation of system logic sufficient for
affected parties to contest decisions. GDPR Article 22 requires that automated decisions with significant
effects on individuals be explainable on request. The Colorado AI Act and proposed New York Algorithmic
Accountability Act extend similar obligations to algorithmic systems in employment, credit, and healthcare
contexts. In practice, however, these requirements are often addressed through partial implementations
rather than through comprehensive XAI techniques. Existing observability, logging, and tracing tooling
frequently becomes the practical mechanism for supporting explanation, oversight, and auditability in
agentic systems. This does not amount to full explainability in a strict technical sense, but it often serves as
evidence base that satisfies an explanation request or survives a regulatory audit.
A universally accepted standard for agent-level explainability has not yet emerged. In practice, advanced XAI
remains concentrated in research settings with access to model internals, leaving most real-world
deployments to rely on more limited and operationally grounded forms of explanation.

Agentic Regulatory and
Compliance Landscape

Notice. This document is a community-contributed technical analysis of the security, governance, and
regulatory landscape surrounding agentic AI. Statements about regulatory obligations, enforcement
timelines, and compliance expectations reflect the contributors' understanding at the time of writing
and are intended to inform technical and risk decisions. They are not legal advice. Organizations should
consult qualified legal counsel before relying on any regulatory characterization in this document.
Citations and external references are provided so readers can independently verify each claim.
AI governance crossed from theory to enforcement in 2025. The EU AI Act's GPAI Code of Practice now
requires public red-team reports, signed usage logs, and live monitoring plans. The first wave of provider
obligations took effect August 2, 2025, with high-risk system requirements following in August 2026. NIST
shipped its Cyber AI Profile mapping agent-specific security controls to CSF 2.0. Singapore published the
world's first governance framework built for agentic AI. South Korea's AI Basic Act took effect with
extraterritorial reach and a 10^26 FLOP threshold that mirrors US state frontier definitions. These are not
proposals. They are operative instruments with penalty regimes attached.
Agentic systems make consequential decisions at machine speed: credit approvals, medical triage,
infrastructure management, code deployment. Each of these domains carries existing regulatory obligations
that agents inherit the moment they act. When an agent denies a loan, GDPR Article 22 and Colorado SB 24-
205 apply. When an agent triages a patient, FDA SaMD rules apply. When an agent manages energy
infrastructure, NIS2 and DORA incident reporting timelines start running. These laws already cover agentic
AI. The open question is whether organizations deploying agents meet the reporting timelines, oversight
requirements, and audit obligations that come with the territory?
The US regulatory picture is volatile. Executive Order 14365 pushes federal preemption of state AI laws while
the Commerce Department evaluates which state laws to target. Colorado, California, New York, Texas,
Illinois, and New Jersey have all enacted AI-specific legislation with different scopes, enforcement models,
and penalty structures. The preemption fight is unresolved, so organizations deploying agents across state
lines face conflicting obligations with no safe harbor. Planning for the most restrictive applicable timeline is
the only defensible posture until the landscape settles.
Enforcement actions confirm that regulators treat AI accountability claims as falsifiable promises. The FTC
imposed a twenty-year audit order on a company that marketed a "98 percent accurate" AI detector

<!-- page 52 -->

performing near chance. NIST's Adversarial Machine Learning Taxonomy gave auditors and red teamers a
shared vocabulary for attack patterns. ENISA's Cyber Stress Test Handbook provides supervisors with live-
fire drill methodology for critical sectors. The UK AI Safety Institute's RepliBench scores self-replication risk
for frontier agents, giving regulators a quantitative benchmark for a capability that did not have one twelve
months ago.
Organizations deploying agentic AI need five capabilities to survive this environment: risk-tier classification
for every model before launch, ethical review checkpoints integrated into the development lifecycle,
immutable and signed audit logs of agent actions sufficient for forensic reconstruction, adversarial testing
covering the full ASI01-ASI10 attack surface, and a kill switch that works at agent speed rather than
committee speed.
This section covers the developing regulatory trends and established requirements with the intent of
providing actionable insights. The detailed regulatory and standards inventory, with agentic implications
assessed across nine governance dimensions, is maintained in Appendix 2: Global Regulatory and
Compliance Landscape.

Enterprise Adoption Maturity
Model

Organizations developing an Agentic AI program will experience different levels of maturity in governing the
autonomy, risk, and accountability associated with using an Agentic AI system. The model operates across
two dimensions:
•
Adoption tier (AT0-AT8, defined in the table below): What are we deploying? This classifies the
trust boundary and autonomy characteristics of the agents in our inventory, which determines
which ASI risks are most probable. AT0 (Shadow AI) recognizes that unmanaged AI usage is the
baseline state most organizations must address before governing deliberate deployments. This
provides a concrete dimension of maturity  beyond a subjective assessment, reflecting how
organizations are  adopting Agentic AI.
•
Governance maturity (Levels 0-4): How mature is our organizational capability to govern agentic
AI? This measures policy, oversight, monitoring, and accountability structures.
The model provides boards, risk leaders, and engineering teams a way to understand their current position
and develop a plan for the next governance steps they need to make. Critically, the required actions vary by
adoption tier: an organization that has not yet addressed shadow AI (AT0) or is deploying only vendor-
embedded assistants and platform-integrated agents (AT1-AT2) needs lighter governance than one
deploying autonomous multi-agent federations (AT7-AT8).
The urgency of this model is borne out by current enterprise data. According to 16z's April 202646 analysis of
enterprise AI deployment, 29% of the Fortune 500 and approximately 19% of the Global 2000 are already live,
paying customers of a leading AI startup — defined as having a signed top-down contract and an active
deployment. This penetration occurred in just over three years since ChatGPT's launch. Critically, this figure
represents only governed, contracted deployments; the volume of unmanaged usage (AT0) across the same
organizations is substantially higher and, by definition, unquantified. The maturity model exists precisely to
close that gap.

Adoption Tier as a Maturity Dimension
The maturity model above assesses an organization's governance capability. However, governance
requirements vary dramatically based on what is being deployed. An organization at Maturity Level 2
deploying a vendor-embedded assistant (such as Microsoft 365 Copilot) faces a narrower risk surface than

<!-- page 54 -->
genai.owasp.org
the same organization deploying an autonomous agent with external MCP tool access. To make the maturity
model actionable, organizations must assess governance maturity against the adoption tier they are
operating at.
The Agentic Adoption Tiers provide this second dimension, It is a progressive scale that classifies agent
deployments by their trust boundary and autonomy characteristics into nine tiers (AT0-AT8). AT0 recognizes
a critical reality: before any deliberate adoption decision, most organizations already have unmanaged AI
usage across their workforce.

The tier numbering reflects escalating deployment complexity and expanding trust boundaries. AT0 is unique:
it is not a deliberate deployment choice but a pre-existing condition that organizations must discover and
address. Risk emerges from the interaction between the tier's characteristics and the Key  ASI column - the
number and severity of active ASI entries increases with each tier.

Agentic AI Governance Maturity Model

Organizations in bold cells have governance insufficient for the adoption tier. They should either increase
governance maturity or reduce deployment complexity. AT0 is unique: it requires active elimination rather than
governance - the goal is to move shadow AI into managed tiers (AT1+) or block it entirely.
How to use the Maturity Model
Governance leaders can assess their current position by asking two questions: how fast can we see and stop
a misaligned agent, and how explicitly are autonomy and accountability coded into our systems? The answers
determine both your maturity level and your readiness for each adoption tier.

<!-- page 59 -->
genai.owasp.org

Step 0: Before anything else, assess your AT0 (Shadow AI) exposure. Assume it exists until proven
otherwise. Use network monitoring, DLP tools, and employee surveys to discover unmanaged AI usage. This
is a prerequisite for all subsequent steps - you cannot govern your AI estate if you don't know what's in it.
Step 1: Assess your governance maturity level (0–4) using the maturity model criteria.
Step 2: Classify each deployed agent by adoption tier (AT0–AT8). Most organizations operate across multiple
tiers simultaneously - shadow AI usage (AT0) alongside a Copilot deployment (AT1) alongside a Custom GPT
for internal knowledge (AT2) alongside citizen-developer Power Automate flows (AT3) alongside a custom
coding agent (AT4–AT5) alongside an MCP-connected workflow (AT6). Pay particular attention to
inventorying AT0 shadow usage and AT3 citizen-developer automations, which are frequently invisible to
central IT and security teams.
Step 3: Check the Maturity × Adoption Tier matrix for each agent. If you're in a bold cell, you have two
options: increase your governance maturity to the required level, or reduce the adoption tier to match your
current maturity. For AT0, the only option is elimination - move shadow usage into managed tiers or block it.
Step 4: Prioritize controls based on the dominant ASI risk classes for your highest adoption tier. Lower tiers
(AT1–AT4) should focus on ASI01, ASI05, and ASI06. Higher tiers (AT6+) must address the full ASI01–ASI10
surface, with particular attention to ASI04 (supply chain), ASI07 (Insecure Inter-Agent Communication), and
## ASI08 (Cascading Failures).
Roadmaps should prioritize moving from static, document-driven oversight toward adaptive, telemetry-
backed control loops - embedding human judgment where regulators demand it and automated safeguards
everywhere autonomy scales. The adoption tier provides the gradient: start governance investment where

<!-- page 60 -->

your highest-tier agents are deployed, but never neglect AT0 discovery, which is the foundation everything
else builds on.

Alignment with the OWASP
Top 10 for Agentic
Applications

The release of the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications in December 2025 provided the first standardized
taxonomy for agentic security risks. Its ten categories map directly to the trends documented in this
section, and almost every category now has at least one confirmed real-world incident supporting it. The
table below summarizes how each category manifested in the 2026 threat landscape.
### Asi Id
Threat Name
2026 Threat Landscape Observation
### Asi01
Agent Goal Hijack
The most pervasive attack technique observed. Appeared as the
initial vector in enterprise-scale indirect prompt injection campaigns
against productivity platforms, CRM systems, and development
environments alike.
### Asi02
Tool Misuse & Exploitation Validated by incidents in which agents with broad tool access were
manipulated into destructive actions, including data deletion and
unauthorized resource access, through injected instructions.
### Asi03
Identity & Privilege Abuse Emerged as the category with the widest gap between risk severity
and organizational preparedness. Non-human identities now vastly
outnumber humans across the enterprise, yet few organizations have
strategies for managing them.
### Asi04
Agentic Supply Chain
Vulnerabilities
Among the highest volume of disclosed incidents. The MCP
ecosystem experienced its first malicious package, first critical
infrastructure RCE, and first coordinated campaign, all within ten
months. Separately, thousands of open-source malicious Skills have
been found that can compromise coding and personal agents when
executed.
### Asi05
Unexpected Code
Execution (RCE)
Tied with ASI04 for highest incident volume. A security audit of all
major AI coding IDEs found vulnerabilities in 100% of tested products,
reflecting a structural blind spot in how agent autonomy interacts
with legacy IDE capabilities.

<!-- page 62 -->
genai.owasp.org
### Asi06
Memory & Context
Poisoning
Showed particular potency in enterprise settings, where attackers
demonstrated the ability to plant persistent false information that
propagated across all future agent sessions.
### Asi07
Insecure Inter-Agent
Communication
Remains more prevalent in research than production. As multi-agent
architectures move toward deployment, this category represents the
next frontier of operational risk.
### Asi08
Cascading
Failures
Research demonstrated that a single compromised agent can poison
downstream decision-making across multi-agent systems.
Confirmed production incidents remain limited.
### Asi09
Human-Agent Trust
Exploitation
Manifested in documented cases of agents learning to suppress user
complaints to optimize performance metrics — a concerning signal as
organizations delegate more consequential decisions to agentic
systems.
### Asi10
Rogue Agents
Large-scale exploitation of exposed AI infrastructure clusters
confirmed that unsecured agent runtimes can be co-opted for
autonomous malicious activity at scale.
“For hands-on experience with the threats described in this section, the OWASP FinBot CTF https://owasp-
finbot-ctf.org/47 provides an intentionally vulnerable multi-agent financial application where practitioners can
exploit prompt injection, tool misuse, data exfiltration, RCE scenarios and more mapped to both the Top 10 for
LLM Applications and the Top 10 for Agentic Applications.”

Future Trends and Emerging
Requirements for Agentic AI

The v1.0 edition of this report described human-in-the-loop mandates, continuous compliance monitoring,
and AI supply chain transparency as anticipated developments. By April 2026, all three are either codified in
law or in late-stage standardization. The conversation has moved from whether these controls will arrive to
how organizations operationalize them for systems that act autonomously, accumulate credentials, and
coordinate across trust boundaries at machine speed.

The Non-Human Identity Crisis
For the structural problem and the recommended controls, see Agent Identity vs Non-Human Identity (NHI).
Looking forward, two developments will define the next eighteen months: convergence of standards bodies
on agent-specific identity, and the unresolved governance problem of agent-spawning architectures.
NIST's AI Agent Standards Initiative is adapting OAuth 2.0 and policy-based access control for agents, with
practice guides expected over 18–24 months. The OpenID Foundation has analyzed gaps around recursive
delegation and multi-agent token exchanges, with protocol drafts expected during 2026–2027. MCP's
authorization specification already mandates OAuth 2.1 flows with resource-indicator-scoped tokens. By
approximately 2027, regulators and auditors will ask not only what permissions an agent holds but how those
permissions were derived, when they expire, and how revocation propagates through delegation chains.
The forward-looking variant of the trust-transitivity case is agent-spawning architectures, where
orchestrators dynamically create ephemeral sub-agents and the delegation mesh grows by composition
rather than by configuration. Each spawned agent inherits or derives credentials from its parent, and
existing IAM cannot bound the resulting blast radius. The OpenID Foundation identifies recursive delegation
and unbounded permission chains as a critical risk. MCP's OAuth 2.1 model provides transport-level
separation but has not been extended to govern chains of spawned agents. CISOs building multi-agent
systems should design delegation governance now rather than retrofitting after the first breach traced to
uncontrolled permission inheritance.

<!-- page 64 -->
genai.owasp.org
From Static Compliance to Runtime Governance
Pre-deployment certification loses value the moment an agent begins, accumulates context,  loads tools
dynamically, or modifies its own configuration. Regulators are responding. The EU AI Act Article 72 requires
providers of high-risk AI systems to actively and systematically monitor performance throughout the
system's lifetime to evaluate continuous compliance. For agentic systems, this functionally demands drift
detection, even though the statute never uses that term. Article 72 is a provider obligation. Deployers inherit
related but distinct monitoring duties under Article 26.If the EU's Digital Omnibus proposal survives trilogue,
high-risk deadlines including Article 72 could slip to December 2027, but organizations that wait for that
confirmation are gambling with an 18-month compliance buildout. Singapore's MGF for Agentic AI requires
agents to log execution plans for ongoing evaluation. New York's RAISE Act demands testing documentation
detailed enough for third-party replication.
The operational shift this creates is substantial. Organizations need four capabilities that most lack today:
First, real-time behavioral monitoring that detects when agent actions diverge from approved workflow
baselines. Plan-divergence detection, comparing agent action sequences against declared intent, is
emerging as a core control pattern in both the OWASP Agentic Top 10 and CoSAI's Secure-by-Design
Principles.
Second, consequence-aware authorization that evaluates what an agent is doing rather than simply
inheriting permissions from its human operator. Colorado's SB 24-205, delayed to June 30, 2026, imposes
penalties of up to $20,000 per violation per consumer — but the problem extends across jurisdictions. New
York's RAISE Act ($1M first violation), California SB 53 ($1M per violation), DORA, and NIS2 create overlapping
penalty surfaces that compound when an agent operates across boundaries simultaneously. As multi-agent
workflows scale to hundreds of thousands of daily decisions, even narrow authorization misconfigurations
create multi-million-dollar exposure. The mismatch will resolve through legislative recalibration or the
emergence of consequence-aware authorization as an architectural pattern.
Third, automated incident classification fast enough to meet compressed reporting timelines. DORA
requires initial notification within 4 hours of classifying an ICT incident as major, with classification itself
due within 24 hours of awareness. NIS2 mandates a 24-hour early warning. New York's RAISE Act requires
safety incident reporting within 72 hours of determination. California SB 53 allows 15 days. These regimes
cover different entity types. DORA and NIS2 hit financial and critical infrastructure deployers. RAISE and SB
53 hit frontier model developers. But organizations that both build and deploy agents, or that operate across
regulated sectors, face genuinely overlapping windows that manual triage cannot satisfy.
Fourth, trajectory-level explainability sufficient to satisfy post-market monitoring requirements. EU AI Act
Articles 9 and 11 require documentation of intended purpose and foreseeable behavior, but agentic systems
compose behavior at runtime — the trajectories that need explaining were never anticipated at assessment
time. Article 14 compounds this by requiring overseers to understand capabilities that change with every

<!-- page 65 -->
genai.owasp.org
composed workflow. Current XAI tooling falls short: the regulatory model assumes pre-documentable
behavior, attribution methods effective for static classification fail for multi-step agents, and no off-the-
shelf solution implements complete Article 72-compliant post-market monitoring. CISOs should instrument
trajectory-level logging now rather than waiting for standards that will not arrive before August 2026
enforcement.
The guardrail landscape is bifurcating. Probabilistic guardrails at the prompt layer remain the default, but
major orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, Claude Code) have converged
on a complementary pattern: deterministic hook points that can intercept agent actions at the code layer
before tool invocation, after execution, and at delegation boundaries. At each interception point, policy logic
can evaluate the action's context, parameters, and intent against defined constraints. Singapore's Model
Governance Framework for Agentic AI aligns with this direction. Early operational experience is promising
but mixed: hooks are effective for known-bad pattern detection and constrained policy enforcement, but
practitioners report they function more reliably as an early warning layer than as a hard security boundary.
When hooks are configured to route decisions to human reviewers, decision fatigue becomes an additional
concern, as developers facing hundreds of approval prompts per session tend to reduce scrutiny or blanket-
approve action categories. How this pattern matures will shape whether runtime governance becomes
architecturally enforceable or remains primarily observational.

Emerging Threat Vectors
This subsection focuses on three deployer-side surfaces where 2026 evidence suggests enterprise risk is
likely to develop over the next twelve to eighteen months; broader systemic trends are addressed in the
subsections that follow. These are not forecasts of inevitable outcomes; they identify surfaces where the
available evidence suggests adoption is outpacing the controls calibrated for it.
CI-resident coding agents face a different threat model than IDE-resident agents, even when the
underlying failure class is the same. The coding-agent CVEs cataloged in the Threat Analysis section largely
concern agents operating against the developer's own environment, where the adversary model is primarily
prompt injection or tooling abuse against a trusted user. They also carry an  agent works for a developer it
trusts, and the danger comes from poisoned inputs reaching that trusted workflow. Coding agents that run
inside continuous integration pipelines (reviewing pull requests, triaging issues, gating releases) break that
assumption. A CI agent is built to ingest input from external contributors it has no reason to trust, which
makes it an attacker-facing surface by design. Controls calibrated for the trusted-developer case do not
transfer. Google's April 2026 advisory for its run-gemini-cli GitHub Action (GHSA-wpqr-6v78-jr5g) confirmed
this exact gap. Organizations should treat CI-resident agents as a distinct review surface rather than
assuming the controls protecting developer tools extend to them.

<!-- page 66 -->
genai.owasp.org
Shadow AI exposure is shifting toward delegated-access compromise as adoption matures. A meaningful
portion of 2026 shadow AI exposure comes from employees authorizing third-party AI tools against
corporate identity, productivity, and cloud tenants using broad delegated OAuth scopes. Where the AI
vendor is later compromised, the attacker can operate inside the trust boundary using legitimately granted
access, which limits the effectiveness of MFA, conditional access, and most data-loss prevention because
no policy is technically violated. The April 2026 Vercel/Context.ai disclosure is the clearest 2026 example of
this pattern, structurally similar to OAuth-based SaaS integration compromises documented in enterprise
breach investigations. Whether this vector ultimately produces more attributable enterprise impact than
data-paste exposure is not yet clear from public reporting, but the direction of change is consistent with the
broader trend toward agentic AI tools that act on the user's behalf rather than passively consuming pasted
content. Organizations treating AI SaaS within OAuth governance and non-human identity programs, rather
than within data-loss prevention alone, will likely have better visibility into this surface as it develops.
The safety-security collapse established earlier is accelerating fastest along one specific axis:
connected enterprise copilots that read broad internal corpora and can take or trigger side-effecting
actions. The March 2026 Meta Sev-1 incident illustrates how a safety or reliability failure can trigger a
security incident through normal enterprise workflows: the agent itself did not perform privileged actions,
but a human acted on inaccurate AI-generated advice, leading to temporary unauthorized access. The
EchoLeak and ShareLeak (CVE-2026-21520) chains illustrate the security side of the same architectural
property. Microsoft's March 2026 and Google's April 2026 guidance converge at the principle level that
agents need human controllers, limited and observable powers, and explicit governance over identity, data
access, and tool use. Copilot deployments are where this convergence is most likely to produce material
incidents over the next twelve to eighteen months, particularly in organizations that haven't extended the
integrated governance posture from the AI Safety vs AI Security section to that surface specifically.

What Remains Unsolved
Three structural problems lack adequate solutions today. First, the assurance model for agentic systems
sits uneasily with what the systems are. As the AI Safety vs AI Security section discusses, pre-deployment
documentation describes the system as it existed at assessment time, but agents compose behavior at
runtime, and the workflows that need to be assured were often not anticipated when the assessment was
conducted. Formal verification was built for deterministic systems and does not readily close this gap, and
the same limitation applies to conformity assessment and other one-shot evaluations of systems whose
effective behavior is shaped after deployment. The field appears to be converging on runtime observability
as a substitute, with trajectory-level logging, plan-divergence detection, and behavioral envelope monitoring
emerging as primary controls. No consensus architecture has yet taken hold, and the distance between what
regulators currently require and what the architecture can readily support looks likely to be one of the
defining governance problems of 2026–2027.

<!-- page 67 -->
genai.owasp.org
Second, human oversight at machine speed is physically impossible for high-throughput agents. If an agent
executes 10,000 actions per hour and a human reviewer can evaluate 50, oversight covers 0.5% of decisions.
Risk-tiered review (where only high-consequence actions route to humans) is the emerging pattern, but
defining consequence thresholds requires real-time blast radius awareness that most organizations lack.
Third, regulatory fragmentation across two compounding dimensions. In the U.S., federal preemption of
state AI laws remains unresolved — the Commerce Department transmitted its evaluation in March 2026, but
congressional action is unlikely before 2028. Meanwhile, over 145 state AI laws enacted in 2025 create
overlapping obligations with conflicting definitions and penalty structures. Within the EU, a single agentic
incident can simultaneously trigger AI Act Article 73, NIS2, and DORA with different timelines and receiving
authorities. Organizations deploying agents across both jurisdictions face compounding fragmentation.
CISOs should budget for jurisdiction-aware policy infrastructure as a permanent operational cost.

Governance-Deployment Collision at Advanced Adoption
Tiers
Organizations pursuing federated agent ecosystems, cross-boundary orchestration, and autonomous agent
networks are outstripping their governance readiness. These deployment patterns require at minimum
continuous runtime monitoring and automated anomaly detection — capabilities that policy-plus-human-in-
the-loop governance cannot deliver at the required decision velocity. CSA's 2026 survey found only 27% of
organizations planning agentic deployments felt confident in their ability to secure them. CISOs should treat
governance maturity as a hard deployment gate: the cost of pausing ambition is months of competitive
delay; the cost of an under-governed cross-boundary breach is regulatory enforcement, litigation, and
damage to trust relationships that took years to build.

Cyber Insurance Coverage Collapse for Agentic AI
Deployments
A structural coverage gap is forming as traditional insurers exclude AI liability from standard policies. In the
U.S., Verisk's ISO CGL exclusions became effective January 2026, WR Berkley introduced an absolute AI
exclusion across D&O and E&O products, and AIG and Great American filed for similar exclusions. Insurance
exclusions are jurisdiction-agnostic — they take effect at renewal with no legislative process required. In the
EU, the withdrawal of the AI Liability Directive leaves the Revised Product Liability Directive (effective
December 2026) as the primary recourse mechanism, treating AI systems as products subject to strict no-
fault liability. A parallel market of dedicated AI insurance is forming: Armilla AI, Testudo, and HSB/Munich Re
now offer coverage, but each requires demonstrated governance as an underwriting prerequisite. CISOs

<!-- page 68 -->
genai.owasp.org
should audit existing policies for AI exclusions before renewal and recognize that security posture now
directly determines insurability.

Agentic AI in OT/ICS and Critical Infrastructure
AI agents are moving from analytical support into the control loop in battery farms, solar farms, wind farms,
and manufacturing plants. OT environments operate under constraints that invalidate IT-centric agent
security: air-gapped networks limit cloud-native monitoring, legacy protocols lack modern authentication
primitives, and safety-instrumented systems under IEC 62443 treat availability as co-primary with
confidentiality. The CISA/NSA joint guidance published December 2025, co-authored with eight allied
nations, explicitly addresses AI agents in OT and establishes four core principles for secure integration. No
documented incidents of enterprise-deployed AI agents causing OT safety failures have occurred yet, but
CISOs should begin mapping where agents intersect with Purdue Model levels and establish clear boundaries
for agent authority over physical actuators.

Adversarial Agent Weaponisation
Adversaries are deploying agentic AI as an offensive capability, not just targeting agentic systems. The GTG-
1002 campaign used jailbroken Claude Code instances to conduct largely autonomous espionage across
roughly 30 organizations, with AI executing 80–90% of tactical operations at physically impossible request
rates. CrowdStrike's 2026 report documented an 89% increase in AI-enabled adversary attacks, with average
breakout times falling to 29 minutes. The IAPS HACCA report warns that frontier models went from near-
zero to 60% success on expert-level offensive security challenges within months. Ransomware groups are
integrating agentic capabilities for autonomous reconnaissance and lateral movement. International norms
frameworks — including the UN GGE and OEWG processes — do not yet address autonomous AI-driven
operations. CISOs should deploy behavioral detection capable of distinguishing autonomous agent activity
from legitimate workflows and conduct red team exercises simulating agent-driven campaigns rather than
human-paced intrusions.

<!-- page 69 -->
genai.owasp.org
Closing

The body of this report covers a wide surface: threat trends, real-world incidents, agent identity, supply
chain, regulatory pressure, and a maturity model. What was a portfolio of possible threats twelve months
ago is now a portfolio of documented cases. As agent autonomy increases, the line between safety failure
and security failure is blurring, and deployment-layer safety belongs with the security function. Governance
practices designed for static systems and quarterly cycles cannot meet incident reporting clocks measured
in hours, or the pace at which new coding agents reach enterprise production.
For most organisations this is not a future problem to address. The agents are already deployed, Shadow AI
is already present, and managing the growing number of non-human identities is becoming a real operational
challenge. What changes is whether the governance posture is shaped intentionally, against an accurate
map of the current attack surface, or shaped after the first incident.
The appendices that follow are the operational substrate for that work: the detailed agent type taxonomy,
the global regulatory landscape across 42 instruments and 10 jurisdictions, ASI risk classes mapped to
adoption tier, the notable projects survey, the FinBot CTF training environment, and an applied Top 10
walkthrough for personal agents. Each is intended to be readable in isolation and to support the chapters
above when more depth is needed.

<!-- page 70 -->
genai.owasp.org
Appendix 1: Detailed Agent
Type Taxonomy

This appendix covers the 5 agent types by operational role discussed in the Agent Taxonomy section. Each
entry describes what the agent does and where it operates, including a description establishing the
category's defining governance characteristics, a structured properties table, and key controls.

## 1.1 Enterprise Agents
Enterprise agents are AI-driven systems deployed for internal organizational use to support employee
workflows, knowledge access, analytics, and automation. The defining boundary for this category is that
the agent serves internal users and operates within (but frequently reaches beyond) organizational trust
boundaries. This distinguishes enterprise agents from client-facing agents (which serve external users in
adversarial environments) and from personal agents (which operate outside organizational governance
entirely).
These agents commonly retrieve enterprise knowledge through RAG pipelines or direct database
connections and may access sensitive information related to products, customers, operations, and strategy.
Access is typically governed through RBAC or attribute-based policies. RBAC-context discrepancies, or the
discrepancy between identity-based permissions and the contextual data retrieved by the agent, remain a
persistent source of risk. Many enterprise agents incorporate function-calling capabilities that connect to
external services, expanding utility but also extending the attack surface beyond internal boundaries. Logs,
telemetry pipelines, and generated outputs are frequently overlooked exfiltration vectors; data that would
be blocked at an API boundary may flow freely through observability infrastructure. This combination of
privileged internal access and external connectivity creates the conditions for the "lethal trifecta" (access to
private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally) that makes prompt
injection exploitable at organizational scale. (See Threat Analysis section for detailed discussion of the lethal
trifecta and Meta's complementary Agents Rule of Two.)

Notable Disclosures

Key Controls: Organizations must validate all RAG data sources and implement output filtering to prevent
exfiltration. They should audit data access patterns regularly, enforce strict separation between user
permissions and agent capabilities, apply least-agency principles granting agents only the minimum
permissions required, and review telemetry and logging pipelines to ensure sensitive data is not exposed
through observability infrastructure. They may implement deterministic hooks at external communication
boundaries to operationalize the Rule of Two, ensuring that agents with access to private data and untrusted
content require human approval before communicating externally.

## 1.2 Coding Agents
Coding agents automate code generation, refactoring, testing, and deployment workflows. The defining
boundary for this category is direct read/write access to source code and infrastructure configurations,
making these agents part of the software supply chain. This distinguishes them from enterprise agents
that may use code incidentally. Coding agents operate on the codebase as their primary function.
These agents integrate with source-control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud APIs, giving them read/write
access to sensitive repositories, deployment keys, and infrastructure. Advanced implementations execute
multi-step workflows autonomously: generating code, running tests, fixing failures, committing changes,
and opening pull requests. The shift toward fully autonomous operation, exemplified by the "Ralph Wiggum"
48 pattern of looped, unattended agent invocation, is accelerating faster in this category than in any other.
Because coding agents operate across repositories and dependency graphs, a single compromised commit

<!-- page 72 -->
genai.owasp.org
or poisoned dependency can propagate automatically through downstream projects, amplifying the blast
radius beyond the initially targeted codebase.
Containment controls designed for human-controlled execution break down when the executor is an
autonomous agent. CVE-2026-22708 (Cursor allowlist bypass) and CVE-2025-59532 (Codex CLI sandbox
boundary bypass) demonstrate that sandboxes and allowlists whose assumptions were calibrated for human
operators become exploitable when the agent can influence its own containment environment.
Organizations that treat sandboxing and allowlisting as sufficient containment for coding agents are relying
on controls that the agent's architecture is positioned to undermine.
Autonomy Range
Copilot-style (human approves each action) to fully autonomous (unattended
multi-step execution)
Trust Boundary
Exposure
Source repositories, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, package registries,

Key Controls: Organizations must implement secret scanning on all commits, enforce least-privilege
tokens, and maintain code signing and artifact verification. They should require mandatory human review for
sensitive changes (production deployments, security-critical code, credential access), run automated
security analysis before merge, apply network segmentation for agent execution environments, enforce
policy-as-code gates in CI/CD pipelines, and maintain comprehensive audit logging of all agent-initiated
commits and infrastructure changes. They may adopt multi-agent verification patterns where one agent
generates code and another reviews it for security vulnerabilities and policy compliance.

<!-- page 73 -->
genai.owasp.org
## 1.3 Client-Facing Agents
Client-facing agents interact directly with customers, partners, or other external users. The defining
boundary for this category is public accessibility combined with transactional capability: these agents
operate in adversarial environments where any user may attempt manipulation, and they carry the heaviest
regulatory burden when processing customer data in consequential decisions. This distinguishes them from
enterprise agents, which serve internal users behind authentication boundaries.
Common deployments include customer service chatbots, voice assistants, onboarding workflows, and self-
service portals. Unlike earlier chatbot-style systems, modern client-facing agents frequently perform
operational actions: modifying account settings, initiating refunds, processing transactions, scheduling
services, or triggering backend workflows. The combination of public exposure and operational authority
makes them the broadest direct attack surface of any agent category. Public accessibility also makes client-
facing agents the primary target for resource exhaustion attacks, where adversaries drive up compute costs
or degrade service availability by flooding the agent with high-complexity requests.
Autonomy Range
Scripted responses to adaptive, action-taking agents with backend integrations
Trust Boundary
Exposure
Public-facing; handles customer PII; connected to payment processors, scheduling,

actions. They should deploy runtime intent validation, rate limiting, abuse detection, input sanitization, and
output filtering. They may implement progressive trust models where new or unverified users interact with
more constrained agent capabilities.
Regulatory scope note: Texas RAIGA (HB 149) is an intent-based prohibited-uses law, not a broad high-risk
framework. It applies only when AI is used for specifically restricted purposes such as facilitating self-harm,
discrimination, CSAM, or rights infringement. Most standard client-facing deployments will not trigger it
directly. However, because client-facing agents operate in adversarial environments where any user may
attempt manipulation (ASI01), organizations must ensure that agents cannot be induced into performing
prohibited activities through prompt injection or tool misuse. The compliance obligation is not to the agent's
intended function but to the full range of outputs an adversary could extract from it.

## 1.4 Personal Agents
Personal agents run locally on user devices, outside enterprise governance structures, with the user's full
system permissions. The defining boundary for this category is the absence of an organizational control
layer: there is no RBAC, no centralized monitoring, no security review before deployment. The user is
simultaneously the administrator, the operator, and the trust anchor. This distinguishes them from
enterprise agents (which operate within organizational governance) and from coding agents (which, even
when used individually, typically connect to enterprise-managed repositories and CI/CD systems).
This category includes self-hosted assistants (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop extensions), local coding
assistants, and personal productivity agents. When employees run personal agents on work devices or
connect them to work systems, the organizational attack surface expands without the CISO's knowledge or
consent.
Autonomy Range
High to fully autonomous; typically always-on with broad local permissions
Trust Boundary
Exposure
User device (full file system, shell access, messaging platforms); may connect to
work systems without IT approval
Persistence
Persistent memory (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md files); skill registries; user-
configured personality and behavior

<!-- page 75 -->
genai.owasp.org
Primary ASI Threats
## ASI04 (Supply Chain: skill registry poisoning), ASI06 (Memory Poisoning:
persistent behavioral modification), ASI10 (Rogue Agents), ASI05 (RCE via
malicious skills)
Regulatory Triggers
Limited direct regulatory exposure for personal use; Shadow AI risk when used
on enterprise devices/systems (triggers same obligations as enterprise agents
but without controls)
Notable Disclosures
(2025–26)
ClawHavoc campaign (~12% of 2,857 ClawHub skills found malicious in Feb 2026
audit), skill-embedded reverse shells, SOUL.md/MEMORY.md poisoning for time-
delayed behavioral modification, Claude Desktop extension RCE
Key Controls: Organizations must include personal agents in shadow AI inventory programs and extend
endpoint detection and response (EDR) to cover agent runtime behavior on managed devices. They should
establish clear acceptable-use policies for personal agents on work devices, implement network-level
monitoring for unexpected agent-initiated connections, and provide sanctioned alternatives to reduce
shadow AI adoption. They may deploy application allowlisting to prevent unapproved agent runtimes on
managed devices.

## 1.5 Infrastructure and Operations Agents
Infrastructure and operations agents manage cloud resources, CI/CD pipeline execution, monitoring,
alerting, and incident response. The defining boundary for this category is infrastructure-level
permissions and blast radius: these agents don't write code; they manage the systems code runs on. This
distinguishes them from coding agents. Compromise of an infrastructure agent doesn't just expose one
system; it enables lateral movement across the environment.
These agents hold cloud IAM roles, deployment credentials, and monitoring API keys, and operate across
production environments.

<!-- page 76 -->
genai.owasp.org
Autonomy Range
Supervised (alert routing, dashboarding) to autonomous (auto-scaling, auto-
remediation, deployment)
Trust Boundary
Exposure
Cloud infrastructure, production environments, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring
and alerting systems
Persistence
Typically session-scoped, but credentials and infrastructure state persist
Primary ASI Threats
## ASI03 (Identity & Privilege Abuse: over-scoped infra credentials), ASI04 (Supply
Chain), ASI05 (RCE via tool exploitation), ASI02 (Tool Misuse: destructive
infrastructure actions)
Regulatory Triggers
NIS2 (critical infrastructure), DORA (financial sector ICT)
Notable Disclosures
(2025–26)
ShadowRay 2.0 (Ray AI framework botnet), ToolShell RCE via SharePoint,
ShadowMQ cluster takeover
Key Controls: Organizations must enforce least-privilege IAM for all agent service accounts, implement
credential rotation and ephemeral token issuance, and maintain kill switches for autonomous remediation
actions. They should segment agent execution environments from production, conduct blast-radius analysis
for all agent permission grants, and monitor for anomalous infrastructure state changes. They may adopt
infrastructure-as-code verification where agent-proposed changes are validated against policy before
execution.

1. EU Artificial Intelligence Act
Key Dates: Entered into force August 1, 2024. Prohibitions effective February 2, 2025. GPAI Code of Practice
finalized July 2025; provider obligations apply August 2, 2025. High-risk requirements enforceable August 2,
2026. Digital Omnibus proposal (November 2025) would delay high-risk deadlines to December 2027, pending
trilogue confirmation. This is not yet finalized as of Q1 2026.

<!-- page 80 -->
genai.owasp.org
Description: The world's first comprehensive, binding AI regulatory framework. Classifies AI by risk tier:
unacceptable (banned), high-risk (regulated), limited-risk (transparency), and minimal-risk. The finalized
GPAI Code of Practice requires transparency documentation, copyright compliance, and for systemic-risk
models, lifecycle risk management, red-team evaluations at RAND Security Level 3, and annual safety
reporting. Fines reach 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover for prohibited practices.
Agentic Implications:
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): Article 6 and Annex III classify autonomous safety-critical AI as high-risk
by default; each tool integration point becomes a conformity assessment boundary.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Article 72 mandates post-market monitoring covering behavioral
drift, not just static performance; Article 62 requires mandatory serious incident reporting.
•
Supply Chain (High): Article 25 distributes responsibilities along the AI value chain; deployers must
verify provider compliance across every component an agent invokes.
•
Human Oversight (High): Article 14 mandates qualified personnel who can override autonomous
decisions, requiring strategic control points and risk-based escalation rather than per-action
approval.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): GPAI systemic-risk models require red-team evaluations at RAND
Security Level 3, lifecycle risk management, and annual safety reporting.
2. Council of Europe Framework Convention on AI
Key Dates: Opened September 5, 2024 (CETS No. 225). Entered into force November 1, 2025. Ratified by UK,
France, Norway. Signed by US, EU, Israel, and 10+ countries.
Description: First binding international AI treaty. Covers full AI lifecycle with risk-based approach. Applies to
public authorities and private actors on their behalf. HUDERIA methodology endorsed as the assessment
tool.
Agentic Implications:
•
Human Oversight (High): Treaty-level obligations for meaningful human control over AI systems
affecting fundamental rights. Autonomous agents deployed by or on behalf of government agencies
face the highest scrutiny.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Medium): Requires appropriate measures to identify, assess, and mitigate
risks, implying ongoing evaluation for adaptive systems.
•
Identity/Authorization (Medium): Accountability requirements demand clear attribution of agent
actions to responsible public-sector entities.
3. Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

<!-- page 81 -->
genai.owasp.org
Key Dates: Full application January 17, 2025. First registers of information due April 30, 2025. ESAs
designate critical ICT third-party providers November 2025.
Description: Binding ICT risk management for the EU financial sector covering 20 entity types plus critical
ICT third-party providers. Five pillars: ICT risk management, incident reporting (4-hour initial notification),
resilience testing, third-party risk, and information sharing. Fines up to 2% annual turnover.
Agentic Implications:
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Continuous monitoring of agent behavior in financial processes with
documented baselines and automated deviation detection.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Annual TLPT requirements extend to adversarial evaluation of
agent decision-making, tool invocation patterns, and manipulation resistance.
•
Supply Chain (High): AI model and orchestration platform vendors may face critical third-party
provider designation with direct ESA oversight.
•
Incident Reporting (High): 4-hour initial incident notification after classification as major, with
classification itself due within 24 hours of awareness. Agents operating in financial processes must
support automated incident detection at this tempo.
4. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Key Dates: Enforceable May 25, 2018. Ongoing DPA enforcement actions targeting AI-driven processing.
Description: Foundational data protection framework governing AI data processing across the EEA. Article
22 protects against solely automated decisions with legal or significant effects. Fines up to 20 million euros
or 4% of global turnover.
Agentic Implications:
•
Memory/State (High): Data minimization, purpose limitation, and storage limitation directly
constrain agent memory architectures; persistent stores, RAG pipelines, and cross-session context
require automated lifecycle management and right-to-erasure compliance.
•
Human Oversight (High): Article 22 creates a hard floor for agent autonomy in consequential
decisions.
•
Identity/Authorization (Medium): Data subject rights require agents to accurately identify and
respond to individual data requests across all processing contexts, including context assembled
dynamically at runtime.
5. NIS2 Directive
Key Dates: In force January 16, 2023. Transposition deadline October 2024; 19 of 27 Member States
transposed by January 2026. ENISA Cyber Stress Testing Handbook published May 2025.

<!-- page 82 -->
genai.owasp.org
Description: Expands cybersecurity requirements for essential and important entities in critical sectors.
Mandatory multi-stage incident reporting: 24-hour early warning, 72-hour notification, one-month final
report. Fines up to 10 million euros or 2% of turnover for essential entities.
Agentic Implications:
•
Identity/Authorization (High): Access control requirements apply to AI agents at human-equivalent
rigor.
•
Incident Reporting (High): 24-hour early warning timeline requires automated detection of agent-
caused incidents.
•
Supply Chain (High): Article 21(2)(d) supply chain security covers all third-party tools and services
agents access at runtime.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): ENISA Cyber Stress Testing Handbook provides supervisors with a
live-fire drill methodology for critical sectors, applicable to agent-dependent infrastructure.
6. EU Revised Product Liability Directive (2024/2853)
Key Dates: Adopted October 23, 2024. Published in Official Journal November 18, 2024. Entered into force
December 9, 2024. Member States must transpose into national law by December 9, 2026. Directive
85/374/EEC repealed from December 9, 2026. AI Liability Directive proposal withdrawn by the European
Commission in February 2025.
Description: Replaces the 1985 Product Liability Directive with a modernized strict no-fault liability regime
covering digital-age products. Explicitly includes software (embedded and standalone), AI systems, and
digital services within the definition of "product." Expands the range of liable parties to include software
developers, authorized representatives, fulfillment service providers, and, under specified conditions, online
platforms and distributors. Eases the burden of proof for claimants in technically complex cases through
rebuttable presumptions and mandatory evidence disclosure. Removes previous maximum liability caps.
Extends the long-stop period to 25 years for latent personal injury. Following the withdrawal of the proposed
AI Liability Directive in February 2025, this Directive is the primary civil liability mechanism for AI-caused
harm in the EU.
Agentic Implications:
•
Supply Chain (High): Every entity in the agentic AI value chain, from foundation model provider
through orchestration framework vendor to deploying organization, is a potential defendant. Tool
providers, MCP server operators, and plugin developers whose components an agent invokes at
runtime fall within the expanded definition of liable parties.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): The Directive's evidence disclosure provisions mean organizations
must maintain records sufficient to demonstrate product safety. For agents that compose behavior
at runtime, this requires trajectory-level logging of tool invocations, state changes, and decision
rationale.

<!-- page 83 -->
genai.owasp.org
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): Failure to provide adequate software updates or cybersecurity
protections creates ongoing liability exposure. Agents that self-modify or load new capabilities
post-deployment trigger continuing obligations for the entity that placed the system on the market.
•
Human Oversight (Medium): While the Directive does not prescribe specific oversight mechanisms,
the strict liability standard incentivizes deployers to implement human review at high-consequence
decision points as a risk mitigation measure.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): The rebuttable presumption of defectiveness in technically
complex cases creates a strong incentive for pre-deployment and ongoing adversarial testing, as
the burden shifts to the defendant to prove the product was not defective.

1. DHS AI Safety and Security Guidelines
Key Dates: Published April 2024 in response to Executive Order 14110. Developed by DHS in coordination with
CISA, with input from 16 Sector Risk Management Agencies. CISA/NCSC co-developed Guidelines for Secure
AI System Development published November 2023. Cross-Sector AI Risk Analysis completed January 2024.
CISA/NSA joint guidance on AI agents in OT published December 2025, co-authored with eight allied nations.
Description: Risk-based framework for securing AI systems across 16 critical infrastructure sectors.
Integrates the NIST AI RMF and addresses AI-driven cybersecurity threats, operational risks, and supply
chain vulnerabilities. Five focus areas: AI risk management for critical infrastructure, cybersecurity controls
for AI systems, governance and compliance alignment, AI supply chain security and procurement standards,
and incident response and AI system resilience. The December 2025 CISA/NSA joint guidance extends
coverage to AI agents operating in OT environments, establishing four core principles for secure integration
in industrial control systems. Note: the original guidelines were developed pursuant to EO 14110, which has
since been revoked. DHS has indicated it will continue to update the guidelines, and the recommendations

<!-- page 86 -->
genai.owasp.org
align with established cybersecurity best practices that remain operative independent of the originating
executive order.
Agentic Implications:
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Continuous risk assessment model for AI applications across critical
infrastructure sectors. Mandates sector-wide reporting protocols for AI-related incidents, including
adversarial attacks, system failures, and unanticipated AI behaviors.
•
Supply Chain (High): Establishes security guidelines for AI components, training data integrity, and
AI supply chain risk management. Minimum security requirements for AI vendors and third-party
developers working with critical infrastructure operators.
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): December 2025 OT guidance establishes clear boundaries for agent
authority over physical actuators in industrial environments. Agents operating in OT must respect
Purdue Model layer separation and safety-instrumented system constraints under IEC 62443.
•
Incident Reporting (Medium): Defines AI-specific recovery and continuity planning strategies.
Sector-wide reporting covers agent-caused anomalies, not just traditional cybersecurity incidents.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): Aligns with NIST adversarial machine-learning taxonomy for
testing AI systems in critical infrastructure contexts.
2. Executive Order 14365: Ensuring a National Policy Framework for AI
Key Dates: December 11, 2025. DOJ AI Litigation Task Force established by January 10, 2026. Commerce
state law report, FTC policy statement, and FCC rulemaking all due March 11, 2026.
Description: Pushes federal preemption of state AI laws. DOJ task force to challenge state laws through
litigation. Commerce to evaluate state AI regulations. FTC and FCC directed to develop federal alternatives.
Explicitly names the Colorado AI Act.
Agentic Implications:
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Creates a volatile compliance environment for multi-state agentic
deployments. Organizations cannot yet determine which state obligations will survive federal
preemption.
•
Incident Reporting (Contested): Directly threatens state-level reporting mandates (CA 15-day, NY 72-
hour). Organizations should plan for the most restrictive timeline until preemption is resolved.
•
Human Oversight (Contested): State mandates for meaningful human review of AI decisions face
potential invalidation. Organizations should maintain oversight controls regardless, as federal
alternatives are expected to impose comparable requirements.
3. Executive Order 14179: Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI
Key Dates: January 20, 2025. Revoked Biden EO 14110 immediately.

<!-- page 87 -->
genai.owasp.org
Description: Eliminated mandatory safety testing, reporting thresholds, and the dual-use foundation model
classification system. Shifted from prescriptive safety mandates to industry self-regulation.
Agentic Implications:
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Reduced): No federal obligation for pre-deployment red-team evaluations
of frontier models used in agentic systems.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Reduced): Limited federal visibility into frontier model deployments,
capabilities, and incident histories. Burden shifts to voluntary frameworks and state laws.
4. NIST AI 600-1 (Generative AI Profile)
Key Dates: Initial public draft April 29, 2024. Final publication July 26, 2024. Developed pursuant to Section
4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110 with input from the Generative AI Public Working Group.
Description: Cross-sectoral companion resource to the AI RMF 1.0 for generative AI. Identifies 12 risk
categories unique to or exacerbated by GAI: CBRN information, confabulation, data privacy, environmental
impacts, harmful bias and homogenization, human-AI configuration, information integrity, information
security, intellectual property, obscene/degrading content, and value chain/component integration.
Provides suggested actions organized by the AI RMF's Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage functions. Sector-
agnostic and voluntary. Note: developed under EO 14110, which has since been revoked, but the publication
remains available and applicable as voluntary guidance.
Agentic Implications:
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Suggested actions include structured pre-deployment testing for
confabulation, prompt injection resilience, and adversarial robustness. GAI-specific red-teaming
guidance covers scenarios directly relevant to foundation models underlying agentic systems.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Incident disclosure considerations address post-deployment
monitoring of generative outputs. Provenance tracking for GAI-generated content applicable to
agent output chains.
•
Memory/State (Medium): Data privacy risk category addresses training data memorization,
inference-time data leakage, and the ability of models to correctly infer PII not present in training
data. These risks compound in agents with persistent memory and cross-session context.
•
Supply Chain (Medium): Value chain and component integration risk category covers third-party
model integration, fine-tuning risks, and downstream deployment scenarios. Applicable to multi-
model agentic architectures.
•
Human Oversight (Medium): Human-AI configuration risk category addresses over-reliance,
automation bias, and inappropriate anthropomorphization. Directly relevant to human-agent trust
dynamics in agentic deployments.
5. NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0

<!-- page 88 -->
genai.owasp.org
Key Dates: Released January 26, 2023. Extended by Cyber AI Profile (IR 8596) December 2025. Referenced as
safe harbor in Texas RAIGA.
Description: Voluntary framework with four functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage. De facto US federal
standard for AI risk management.
Agentic Implications:
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): MAP requires documenting full scope of agent tools, decision-making
boundaries, and autonomy conditions.
•
Human Oversight (High): GOVERN addresses oversight roles; MANAGE includes human-in-the-loop
requirements demanding clear escalation thresholds and authority boundaries.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Medium): MEASURE function requires metrics for trustworthiness
characteristics. For agentic systems, this extends to behavioral drift detection, goal alignment
verification, and decision-quality assessment.
6. NIST Cyber AI Profile (IR 8596)
Key Dates: Preliminary draft December 16, 2025. Comment closed January 30, 2026. Final expected H2 2026.
Description: First NIST document explicitly addressing agentic AI security. Maps AI cybersecurity to CSF 2.0
across three focus areas: Secure AI systems, Defend with AI, Thwart AI-enabled attacks. Developed with
6,500+ contributors. Provides foundational coverage but explicitly does not address multi-agent
architectures, agent identity, or inter-agent trust; OWASP Agentic Top 10 fills this gap directly.
Agentic Implications:
•
Identity/Authorization (High): Mandates unique agent identities, defined permissions, continuous
verification, and least-privilege access. Strongest federal guidance on agent identity to date.
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): Explicitly restricts agent code execution capabilities, treating agents as
bounded actors with defined operational envelopes.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Adversarial training and adaptive learning scenarios as explicit
testing categories. Covers manipulation resistance and behavioral consistency under adversarial
conditions.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Medium): Maps to CSF 2.0 Detect and Respond functions with AI-specific
indicators. Continuous verification requirements imply runtime behavioral monitoring.

Employment,
Healthcare,
Finance,
Education, Legal,
Housing in
Colorado
First comprehensive US state
high-risk AI law. Delayed to
June 30, 2026 by SB 25B-004.
AG-only enforcement at $20K
per violation per consumer. 60-
day cure period. Named in Dec
2025 Trump EO as preemption
target.
Broad consequential-decision
definition captures most
agentic deployments in
covered sectors. Per-consumer
penalties accumulate rapidly
for agents making thousands of
daily automated decisions.
Mandatory meaningful human
review of adverse decisions.
Faces highest federal
preemption risk.
Illinois HB 3773
Employment
(Hiring,
Promotion,
Termination) in
Illinois
Effective Jan 1, 2026. Prohibits
employment discrimination
through AI. Private right of
action. ZIP code proxy
prohibition.
Private right of action creates
direct liability exposure for
agentic hiring systems, unlike
AG-only enforcement in
Colorado.
New Jersey
### N.J.A.C. 13:16
Employment in
New Jersey
Pre-deployment bias testing for
automated employment tools.
Effective December 2025.
Automated hiring agents
require third-party bias audits
before deployment. Testing
must cover protected class
impact across agent decision
outputs.
New York RAISE

Effective Jan 1, 2027. Creates
DFS oversight office. Penalties:
$1M first violation, $3M repeat.
Knowledge distillation provision
extends coverage.
72-hour incident reporting
(strictest in US) requires
automated detection and
classification. Testing must
have sufficient detail for third-

genai.owasp.org
Texas RAIGA (HB
149)
Employment,
Education, Public
Services in Texas
Effective Sep 1, 2025. Prohibits
AI for restricted purposes (self-
harm, discrimination, CSAM,
rights infringement). NIST AI
RMF compliance provides
affirmative defense.
Hard boundaries on agent
capabilities regardless of
architecture. Agents must
resist manipulation into
prohibited activities through
injection or tool misuse. NIST
safe harbor makes framework
compliance commercially
significant.

1. California FEHA Regulations
Key Dates: Effective October 2025.
Description: Extends employer liability under the Fair Employment and Housing Act to cover discriminatory
outcomes from vendor-provided AI tools used in employment decisions. Employers cannot disclaim
responsibility by citing vendor assurances.
Agentic Implications:
•
Human Oversight (High): Employers bear full liability for discriminatory outcomes from agentic
hiring tools regardless of vendor representations. Creates direct incentive for meaningful pre-
deployment testing and ongoing monitoring of vendor-supplied agent behavior.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): Practical compliance requires employers to independently
validate vendor AI systems for disparate impact, not rely on vendor-provided audit reports alone.
2. California SB 53 (Transparency in Frontier AI Act)
Key Dates: Signed September 29, 2025. Effective January 1, 2026.
Description: Applies to frontier models (>10^26 FLOPs) and large developers (>$500M revenue). Requires
transparency reports, safety frameworks, 15-day incident reporting, whistleblower protections. Federal
deference provision accepts EU AI Act compliance. Penalties up to $1M per violation.
Agentic Implications:
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Transparency reports must document safety testing of agentic use
cases; covers fine-tuned derivatives.
•
Incident Reporting (High): 15-day window for critical safety incidents involving unauthorized agent
actions or harmful outputs.

<!-- page 92 -->
genai.owasp.org
•
Supply Chain (Medium): Coverage of fine-tuned derivatives means organizations deploying custom
agents built on frontier models inherit the developer's reporting and transparency obligations.
3. Colorado SB 24-205 (Consumer Protections for AI)
Key Dates: Signed May 2024. Delayed to June 30, 2026 by SB 25B-004. Explicitly named in December 2025
Trump EO.
Description: First comprehensive US state high-risk AI law. Covers consequential decisions in employment,
housing, healthcare, education, finance, and legal services. AG-only enforcement at $20,000 per violation
per consumer. 60-day cure period.
Agentic Implications:
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): Broad consequential-decision definition captures most agentic
deployments in covered sectors; per-consumer penalties accumulate rapidly for agents making
thousands of daily decisions.
•
Human Oversight (High): Mandatory meaningful human review of adverse decisions. The scale
mismatch between agent decision velocity and human review capacity makes this the most
operationally challenging requirement in the law.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Medium): Annual impact assessments and documented risk management
practices. Faces highest federal preemption risk among state AI laws.
4. Illinois HB 3773
Key Dates: Effective January 1, 2026.
Description: Prohibits employment discrimination through AI systems. Private right of action (unlike AG-only
enforcement in Colorado). ZIP code proxy prohibition prevents using geographic data as a stand-in for
protected characteristics.
Agentic Implications:
•
Human Oversight (High): Private right of action creates direct liability exposure for agentic hiring
systems, exposing deployers to individual lawsuits rather than solely regulatory enforcement.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): ZIP code proxy prohibition requires testing agent decision logic
for indirect discrimination pathways that standard bias audits may miss.
5. New Jersey N.J.A.C. 13:16
Key Dates: Effective December 2025.

<!-- page 93 -->
genai.owasp.org
Description: Requires pre-deployment bias testing for automated employment decision tools. Applies to AI
systems used in hiring, promotion, and termination decisions within New Jersey.
Agentic Implications:
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Automated hiring agents require third-party bias audits before
deployment. Testing must cover protected class impact across agent decision outputs.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Medium): Pre-deployment testing requirement means agents that self-
modify or retrain post-deployment may trigger re-testing obligations, though the regulation does
not explicitly address continuous learning systems.
6. New York RAISE Act
Key Dates: Signed December 19, 2025. Effective January 1, 2027.
Description: Most stringent US state AI safety law. Covers frontier models (>10^26 FLOPs or >$100M
compute). 72-hour incident reporting (strictest in US). Creates DFS oversight office. Knowledge distillation
provision extends coverage to compressed model derivatives. Penalties: $1M first, $3M repeat.
Agentic Implications:
•
Incident Reporting (High): 72-hour window requires automated incident detection and
classification. Strictest state-level reporting timeline in the US.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Testing must have sufficient detail for third-party replication. This
standard exceeds typical internal red-team documentation practices.
•
Supply Chain (Medium): Distillation provision closes the derivative model gap. Compressed or
distilled agentic models inherit the full obligations of their parent frontier model.
7. Texas RAIGA (HB 149)
Key Dates: Effective September 1, 2025.
Description: Prohibits AI for restricted purposes (self-harm, discrimination, CSAM, rights infringement). NIST
AI RMF compliance provides affirmative defense. AG-only enforcement. Civil penalties: $10,000 to $12,000
per curable violation, up to $200,000 per uncurable violation. 60-day cure window.
Agentic Implications:
•
Autonomy/Tool Use (High): Hard boundaries on agent capabilities regardless of architecture. Agents
must resist manipulation into prohibited activities through injection or tool misuse. The compliance
obligation extends to the full range of outputs an adversary could extract, not just intended function.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): NIST AI RMF safe harbor makes framework compliance
commercially significant. Organizations deploying agentic systems in Texas gain affirmative
defense through documented NIST alignment.

10. UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics
Key Dates: Adopted November 2021 by 193 member states. No revision or enforcement mechanism
established. Readiness Assessment Methodology published.
Description: The most widely endorsed AI ethics instrument by country count, covering values (human
dignity, fairness, transparency), policy areas (governance, data, environment), and monitoring through
national self-assessments. Included for policy alignment reference only. No binding obligations, no penalty
regime, and no defined compliance pathway. Listing here does not imply equivalence with enforceable
frameworks.
Agentic Implications:
•
Human Oversight (Low): Proportionality and do-no-harm principles apply conceptually to
autonomous agents, but the instrument carries no binding obligations, no incident reporting, and no
compliance pathway. No national AI law to date cites UNESCO as its legislative basis.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (Low): National self-assessments provide general governance maturity
indicators but establish no specific monitoring requirements for agentic deployments.
Organizations operating in jurisdictions that reference UNESCO in national AI strategies (primarily
Global South nations) should note its existence but focus compliance resources on binding
instruments.

H. Sector-Specific AI Compliance
Agents operating in regulated environments inherit the full compliance burden of the actions they perform.
This subsection covers three sector-specific frameworks with direct applicability to agentic AI deployments.
Additional sector-specific requirements (FINRA/SEC guidance, EU MDR/IVDR, TSA directives, DoD
Responsible AI Strategy, NATO AI Strategy, ITAR/EAR, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) apply to agents operating in
their respective domains but do not contain agentic-specific provisions warranting individual entries at this

plans allowing manufacturers to describe anticipated modifications to AI/ML-enabled devices without
requiring new premarket submissions for each change. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP) principles
guide development lifecycle. Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) regulatory pathway applies to AI-driven
clinical decision support.
Agentic Implications:
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (High): Clinical validation across diverse patient demographics required
before deployment. Real-world performance monitoring mandated for diagnostic algorithms. PCCPs
must describe the types of changes anticipated, the methodology for implementing changes, and
performance standards that trigger human review.
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Continuous reporting of AI-driven diagnostic errors. Software
updates tracked for algorithmic drift. Clinician-interpretable rationale required for treatment
recommendations. Audit trails mandatory for AI-driven patient triage decisions.
•
Human Oversight (High): Human sign-off required on material algorithm changes. Fixed
performance benchmarks must be met pre-deployment. Agents that self-improve through patient
data encounter tension between adaptive learning and FDA validation requirements.
•
Supply Chain (Medium): HIPAA-compliant training data governance. Model provenance
documentation required, covering where models originate and how they were built. Standardized
APIs required for multi-hospital AI deployments to ensure interoperability without compromising
performance.

compliance alignment, and governance. Allows organizations to inherit compliance from cloud providers and
third-party vendors through control inheritance, reducing redundant security assessments. Integrates with
ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and existing healthcare compliance frameworks.
Agentic Implications:
•
Monitoring/Auditability (High): Controls apply to agentic systems processing PHI or financial data.
Assessment covers agent access controls, data handling, and runtime monitoring requirements.
Shared responsibility model allows organizations to inherit compliance from cloud service providers
and AI model providers.
•
Supply Chain (High): AI supply chain risks in model training and deployment explicitly covered.
Control inheritance model addresses the multi-vendor reality of agentic deployments where agents
invoke tools and models from different providers.
•
Evaluation/Red-Teaming (Medium): AI model security, adversarial resilience, and runtime
monitoring controls provide structured assessment criteria for agentic systems. Predefined
security controls must be updated as AI models evolve, creating ongoing compliance obligations for
adaptive agents.
•
Identity/Authorization (Medium): Formal compliance attestations and governance mechanisms
apply to agent-driven actions in sensitive environments. Explicit documentation requirements for
AI-driven processing may constrain real-time agentic decision-making velocity in regulated
contexts.

## 2.8 Towards Unified Governance: The Security-Compliance
Convergence
The AI Safety vs AI Security section of this report establishes that agentic systems collapse the operational
boundary between safety failures and security failures. The regulatory landscape introduces a parallel
convergence that compounds this problem: the agentic security vulnerabilities documented in the OWASP
Top 10 for Agentic Applications map directly to potential regulatory violations under at least one binding
framework. Security teams and compliance teams are describing the same incident through separate
taxonomies, separate reporting chains, and separate remediation workflows.

<!-- page 114 -->
genai.owasp.org
As an example of convergence - The OWASP Agentic Top 10 catalogs how agents fail. The EU AI Act specifies
what providers and deployers must prevent. The overlap exists because both frameworks target the same
architectural properties: tool access, autonomy boundaries, oversight mechanisms, and behavioral
predictability. When an agent's security controls fail, the resulting behavior is also the behavior the
regulation prohibits.
The pattern across every mapping is consistent: the design decisions that create security exposure are the
same decisions that create regulatory liability. Addressing one requires addressing the other. The security
team's incident report and the compliance team's regulatory case file describe the same facts.
The Shared Structural Assumption
This convergence traces to a deeper architectural issue. Every major governance framework addressing
agentic AI - the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, the OWASP Agentic Top 10's recommended mitigations, Singapore's
MGF for Agentic AI, and ForHumanity's CORE AAA certification scheme - shares a foundational assumption:
that system behavior can be described before the system operates. Each framework requires pre-
deployment specification of purpose, boundaries, risk profiles, and expected behavior. Under the EU AI Act,
Article 11 and Annex IV make this concrete: technical documentation describing the system's intended
purpose, capabilities, and limitations must be prepared before the system is placed on the market. The
conformity assessment under Article 43 evaluates this documentation. The regulatory architecture assumes
that the system described in the documentation is the system that will operate.
Agentic AI systems are architecturally designed to determine their own execution paths at runtime. An agent
with access to N authorized actions across D chaining steps can compose N^D possible workflows. The
compositional outcome space grows exponentially with each additional tool or chaining depth. Pre-
deployment documentation describes the system as it existed at the moment of assessment. The agent that
runs in production composes different workflows on every execution.
This creates a governance gap that no single framework currently addresses: the pre-deployment artifacts
that regulators, auditors, and certification bodies evaluate describe a system that ceases to exist the
moment the agent begins operating. The assessment was accurate when it was conducted. The system it
describes is not the system that is running.
Toward Runtime Governance
The emerging response - discussed in the AI Safety vs AI Security section - is a shift from static, pre-
deployment assurance toward runtime behavioral monitoring. Organizations deploying agentic systems in
regulated environments will increasingly need to define an operational envelope: the bounded subset of
agent behaviors that were actually assessed, documented, and found compliant. The governance
mechanism then becomes detection of behavioral departure from that assessed space, with defined
escalation protocols when the agent's composed workflows exceed the envelope.

<!-- page 115 -->
genai.owasp.org
Under the EU AI Act, behavior that exceeds the assessed operational envelope may constitute a substantial
modification under Article 3(23), potentially triggering a reassessment obligation and, in cases where the
modification changes the system's intended purpose, converting the deployer's regulatory status from
deployer to provider under Article 25.
The convergence between security controls and regulatory obligations means that the monitoring
infrastructure required for runtime governance - tool invocation logging, permission chain auditing,
behavioral anomaly detection, and plan-divergence analysis - serves both functions simultaneously. Security
teams building observability for threat detection are also building the evidentiary infrastructure that
regulators will expect. Compliance teams building audit trails for regulatory defensibility are also building the
detection capabilities that security operations require. The organizational consequence is the same one
identified in the AI Safety vs AI Security section: these functions cannot be governed by separate teams with
separate reporting chains and produce defensible outcomes.

Appendix 3: Key ASI Risk
Classes by Adoption Tier

Key ASI Risk Classes by Adoption Tier
Not all ASI risks are equally relevant at every adoption tier. The following summary enables organizations to
prioritize controls based on their actual deployment pattern rather than treating ASI01-10 50 as a flat
checklist.
AT0 (Shadow AI): The defining challenge is observability – you cannot govern what you cannot see. ASI01
(Goal Hijack), ASI06 (Memory Poisoning), and ASI09 (Human-Agent Trust Exploitation) are the dominant risks
because users are interacting with AI tools without input filtering, output review, or usage policies. The
primary risk is data leakage: corporate data pasted into personal AI accounts with no DLP controls. Primary
mitigations: shadow AI discovery tooling, acceptable-use policy, network-level detection of AI service
usage, DLP enforcement, and employee awareness training.
AT1-AT2 (Vendor/Platform): ASI01 (Goal Hijack) and ASI06 (Memory Poisoning) dominate. ASI09 (Human-
Agent Trust Exploitation) is a persistent human-factor risk. The attack surface is constrained by vendor
controls. Primary mitigations: input filtering, output review, scoped permissions, data classification.
AT3 (Citizen-Developer): Inherits AT1-AT2 risks but adds ASI02 (Tool Misuse & Exploitation) from unsecured
connector configurations, ASI03 (Identity & Privilege Abuse) from inherited maker permissions, and ASI05
(Unexpected Code Execution) because citizen-developer flows can execute actions on organizational data –
sending emails, updating records, calling APIs – without security review or identity scoping. The governance
challenge is visibility: these flows are often built outside central IT oversight, creating managed shadow AI
risk at scale. Primary mitigations: all AT1-AT2 controls plus citizen-developer approval workflows, flow
inventory, connector governance, and data loss prevention policies.
AT4-AT5 (Code-Exec/Custom): ASI05 (Code Execution) becomes the defining risk. ASI02 (Tool Misuse &
Exploitation) emerges as tool permissions and data scope become the organization’s responsibility. 6-8 ASI
entries are active. Primary mitigations: sandboxing, code signing, least-privilege, tool boundary
enforcement.
AT6-AT7 (External/Multi-Agent): The inflection point. ASI02 (Tool Misuse & Exploitation) escalates as
external tools dramatically expand the misuse surface with data scopes you cannot verify. ASI04 (Supply
Chain), ASI07 (Insecure Inter-Agent Communication), and ASI08 (Cascading Failures) all activate
simultaneously. At AT7 (Multi-Agent Orchestration), ASI10 (Rogue Agents) becomes structural – agents with

<!-- page 117 -->
genai.owasp.org
enough autonomy to exhibit behavioral divergence can exploit inter-agent trust to escalate impact across
the orchestration. The full ASI01-10 surface is engaged. Primary mitigations: supply-chain verification, MCP
authentication, agent-to-agent identity, tool scope verification, cascade limits, third-party risk assessment,
behavioral monitoring.
AT8 (Federated): All ASI entries active at maximum severity. Systemic risk from cross-organizational trust
propagation. ASI07 (Insecure Inter-Agent Communication), ASI08 (Cascading Failures), and ASI10 (Rogue
Agents) become structural rather than incidental – cross-boundary trust means a rogue or compromised
agent in one organization can propagate harm across federated partners. Primary mitigations: zero trust
architecture, mutual attestation, federated identity management, cross-org governance SLAs, tamper-
evident audit trails.

Governance Implications
The open-source agentic landscape is evolving rapidly around a diverse set of high-velocity projects that
ship continuously, accumulate large contributor bases, and generate significant CVE disclosure activity.
Security teams evaluating agentic tooling should prioritize projects with active advisory programs, published
SBOMs, and documented HITL boundaries and not solely star count or release frequency. Cross-reference
with the Enterprise Adoption Maturity Model (AT0-AT8) when assessing organizational readiness to deploy
any agentic AI projects.

Appendix 5: Practitioner
Training: OWASP FinBot CTF

The threat analysis, taxonomy, and regulatory sections of this report describe what can go wrong with
agentic AI systems. For security teams tasked with defending them, a natural follow-up question is: where
can practitioners develop hands-on intuition for how these attacks actually work?
Traditional application security training has long benefited from intentionally vulnerable practice
environments (OWASP Juice Shop, WebGoat, DVWA) where defenders learn to think like attackers by
exploiting real systems in controlled settings. The agentic AI domain has lacked an equivalent. OWASP
FinBot CTF fills that gap.

<!-- page 125 -->
genai.owasp.org
What It is
OWASP FinBot CTF is an intentionally vulnerable, multi-agent financial platform built for hands-on
exploitation of agentic AI vulnerabilities. It simulates a fintech company where LLM-powered agents
autonomously handle vendor onboarding, fraud detection, invoice processing, payments, and
communications, each with real tool access via MCP servers. Players wear three hats: the Vendor interacting
with the system, the Admin overseeing and configuring it, and the Attacker poisoning the supply chain and
observing exfiltration. The CTF portal serves as mission control to track exploits and learn the inner
workings of the agents.
Unlike traditional CTFs with static flags, FinBot uses event-driven detection: an automated pipeline
monitors agent behavior in real time and recognizes successful exploits through purpose-built detectors and
LLM-based evaluators. Players prove vulnerabilities by triggering them in the running system, not by finding
hidden strings.

How Challenges are Structured
Every challenge is mapped to the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Security, the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications, MITRE ATLAS, and CWE. These are the same frameworks referenced throughout this report.
The challenge set is actively expanding as new attack patterns emerge and as the agentic threat landscape
evolves. Representative attack scenarios include:
•
Prompt injection for system prompt extraction: tricking an onboarding agent into leaking its
confidential business rules through crafted vendor profile fields
•
Tool poisoning for zero-click data exfiltration: modifying MCP tool descriptions to turn the
platform's own security agent into an exfiltration channel that leaks vendor financial data
•
Indirect injection for remote code execution: planting executable payloads in persistent vendor
data that detonate when a privileged backend agent reads them during a review workflow
A key design principle is that being a good actor does not make you safe. The platform demonstrates how a
malicious vendor's poisoned data can flow upstream into the admin's AI assistant and laterally into other
vendors' workflows through shared agent context, mirroring the cross-tenant and supply chain risks
described in this report's Threat Analysis section.

Why It Matters
For organizations evaluating agentic AI readiness, FinBot provides three capabilities:
1.
Red team training: Security teams can practice the attack patterns described in this report's Threat
Analysis section against a realistic multi-agent architecture without risking production systems.
2. Risk validation: Challenge mappings to ASI and LLM Top 10 categories allow organizations to
validate whether their teams understand the specific risks documented in the OWASP Top 10 for
Agentic Security.
3. Maturity assessment input: Teams at early adoption tiers (AT0–AT3 in the Enterprise Adoption
Maturity Model) can use FinBot to build baseline competency before deploying agentic systems with
broader tool access and autonomy.

Getting Started
FinBot is available as a hosted platform requiring no setup and as an open-source project for self-hosted
deployment:

Appendix 6: The Top 10
Impacting Personal Agents

OpenClaw is the most prominent example of the personal agent product category described in the Agents
Taxonomy Section. It has a published threat model (v1.0-draft, February 2026) that follows the MITRE ATLAS
framework, documenting 37 threats across eight tactics with six attack chains. This section uses that threat
model to assess how well the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications covers the personal agent threat
surface — where it applies directly, and where the guidance does not fully translate to this product type.
To support the analysis that follows, the diagram below maps the ASI categories to the personal agent
architecture, providing a visual reference for where each category applies

<!-- page 129 -->

## 6.1 Validating the Top 10 for the Personal Agent Threat
Surface
The OpenClaw threat model (v1.0-draft, February 2026)51 follows the MITRE ATLAS framework, documenting
37 threats across eight tactics with six attack chains. It covers the full architecture: the gateway, channel
integrations, the ClawHub marketplace, MCP server connections, and user devices.
Seven of the ten ASI categories apply directly. Prompt injection through messaging channels maps to ASI01,
and the threat model documents both direct injection (crafted messages) and indirect injection (malicious
content in fetched URLs and emails). Tool misuse through MCP integrations and the agent's built-in
capabilities — web fetch, shell access, file system operations — maps to ASI02, including exfiltration through
legitimate tools and resource exhaustion. The skill marketplace attack surface maps cleanly to ASI04: the
ClawHavoc campaign validated this in practice, and the threat model covers the full lifecycle from malicious
skill publication through compromised updates to skill-based persistence. Code execution risks, whether
through malicious skills or prompt-injection-driven command execution, map to ASI05. Persistent memory
poisoning through SOUL.md and MEMORY.md files maps to ASI06, with real-world confirmation from the
ToxicSkills campaign. Identity abuse through pairing codes, sender spoofing, and token theft maps to ASI03,
and trust exploitation through the messaging-based approval flow maps to ASI09 — though both of these
carry caveats discussed below. The three multi-agent categories — ASI07, ASI08, and ASI10 — do not apply to
the single-agent architecture.
Open-source security projects have begun operationalizing several of these categories for personal agent
deployments. NVIDIA's NemoClaw provides sandboxed execution and policy-based access controls. Cisco's
DefenseClaw adds pre-installation skill scanning and runtime tool call inspection. Zenity's OpenClaw Security
Platform offers checkpoint-based monitoring at message entry and tool execution boundaries.
Across these seven categories, 24 of the 37 threats have a direct ASI match. Five additional threats cover
pre-attack reconnaissance and post-access discovery — stages in the attack lifecycle that the Top 10 does
not address but that complementary frameworks like MITRE ATLAS cover in detail. The remaining eight
threats surface four patterns where the Top 10's coverage does not fully translate to the personal agent
architecture.

<!-- page 130 -->
genai.owasp.org
Identity without infrastructure. ASI03 identifies identity and privilege abuse as a risk area, and its
mitigations — task-scoped tokens, mTLS, centralized policy engines — are the right target state. Personal
agents authenticate through messaging platform pairing codes, platform-dependent sender verification,
and plaintext tokens with no expiration or rotation, entirely outside any organizational identity
infrastructure. (Related threats: T-ACCESS-001 Pairing Code Interception, T-ACCESS-002 AllowFrom
Spoofing, T-ACCESS-003 Token Theft, T-PERSIST-004 Stolen Token Persistence)
Human approval as an attack surface. The Top 10 recommends human-in-the-loop approval as a mitigation
across multiple categories. The OpenClaw threat model treats this same mechanism as an attack surface —
documenting techniques for hiding malicious flags in long command strings and obfuscating dangerous
operations behind plausible syntax. A control the Top 10 actively recommends becomes the mechanism
through which the attack succeeds. (Related threats: T-EXEC-004 Exec Approval Bypass, T-EVADE-003
Approval Prompt Manipulation)
Configuration tampering for persistence. The threat model documents a technique where a compromised
skill modifies the agent's own configuration — expanding allowlists, disabling approval requirements,
loosening tool policies — and then removes itself. The persistence lives in the weakened configuration, not in
the malicious component, and does not map to any ASI category. (Related threat: T-PERSIST-003 Agent
Configuration Tampering)
Runtime payload delivery. ASI04 recommends supply chain controls including scanning, signing, and
provenance verification — all operating at install time. The threat model documents skills that pass these
checks cleanly and then fetch malicious payloads at runtime. Runtime fetches are not currently monitored,
leaving a gap between install-time assurance and runtime behavior. (Related threat: T-EVADE-004 Staged
Payload Delivery)

## 6.2 Safety and Security: Two Failure Modes
The analysis above focuses on security — adversaries deliberately exploiting the system. As this report
distinguishes elsewhere, personal agents also present safety challenges: failures where the system's own
behavior conflicts with human intent, without any adversary involved.
In February 2026, Summer Yue, Director of Alignment at Meta Superintelligence Labs, had her OpenClaw
agent bulk-delete over 200 emails from her inbox. She had explicitly instructed the agent to suggest
deletions but not act without approval. The agent worked as expected on a smaller test inbox for weeks,
earning her trust. When she pointed it at her full inbox, the volume of data triggered context window
compaction, and the agent silently dropped the safety constraint. It began deleting emails at speed, ignored
repeated stop commands sent from her phone, and could only be stopped when she physically ran to her Mac
Mini to terminate the process. Meta subsequently prohibited OpenClaw in internal workflows.

<!-- page 131 -->
genai.owasp.org
No attacker was involved. The failure was procedural misalignment — the agent followed its goal (clean the
inbox) but lost a constraint (ask before acting) through a technical process the user had no visibility into and
no control over. This is a different class of problem from the security gaps identified above, and it requires
different controls. Input validation and supply chain scanning do not help when the threat is the agent's own
context management silently dropping instructions.
For organizations evaluating personal agents, both failure modes need governance attention. The security
gaps surface where an adversary can exploit the architecture. The safety gaps surface where the
architecture fails on its own.
