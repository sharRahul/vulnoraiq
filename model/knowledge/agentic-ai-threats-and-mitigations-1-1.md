Introduction

Agentic AI represents an advancement in autonomous systems, increasingly enabled by large language
models (LLMs) and generative AI. While agentic AI predates modern LLMs, their integration with generative
AI has significantly expanded their scale, capabilities, and associated risks. This document is the first in a
series of guides from the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) to provide a threat-model-based reference
of emerging agentic threats and discuss mitigations.
This document:
Defines the scope and audience
Provides a definition of agentic terms, capabilities, and architecture
Discusses threat modelling approaches and provides a reference threat model discussing new
agentic threats and mitigations
Illustrates the threats in different settings with threat models for four example scenarios
Documents threats with a structured and detailed Agentic Threat Taxonomy
Details mitigations and playbooks

Scope and Audience
Our work focuses on agents based on large language models (LLMs), as these general-purpose models
revolutionize agentic development and, unlike previous agentic generations, bring more capabilities and
widespread use.
We aim to provide an easy-to-follow, practical, and actionable reference to threats and mitigations of
Agentic AI applications. We introduce some basic concepts and use a reference architecture of agentic AI,
acting as the canvas for threat models, to explain and contextualize agentic threats. However, providing a
detailed definition and architecture of agentic AI is beyond the scope of our work.
Our work focuses on Agentic AI threats and relies on existing guidelines and standards, such as the OWASP
Top 10 for LLM Applications and Generative AI, OWASP AI Exchange, OWASP Top 10, and the OWASP Top 10
for APIs to address related aspects inherent in building AI applications. When relevant, we highlight Agentic
AI's impact on existing threats and risks.
The intended audience of this document are builders and defenders of agentic applications, including
developers, architects, platform and QA engineers, and security professionals. This is our first report, and
we plan to provide additional role-based guides as follow-ups to this document for technical and decision-
making audiences.

AI Agents

An agent is an intelligent software system designed to perceive its environment, reason about it, make
decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives autonomously. More specifically, " Russell and
Norvig define agents in their classic “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” as follows:
“An intelligent agent is "an agent that acts appropriately for its circumstances and its goals, is flexible to
changing environments and goals, learns from experience, and makes appropriate choices given its perceptual
and computational limitations." (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th ed., p. 34”)
AI Agents use Machine Learning (ML) for reasoning; traditional ML approaches (such as Reinforcement
Learning) play a key role in each development. The Open AI Gym (now Farama Foundation’s  Gymnasium),
helped drive  the first wave of Agentic AI. However, the advanced capabilities, NLP interface, and scale of
LLMs have revolutionized agentic AI and accelerated adoption.
As well-known vendors and enterprises are embracing LLM agents, Gartner forecasts that by 2028 33% of
enterprise software applications will utilize agentic AI “enabling 15% of day-to-day work decisions to be made
autonomously”.

Core Capabilities
There are many ways to describe an agent, but typically, an agent or agentic AI system will exhibit the
following elements:
Planning & Reasoning: Agents can reason and decide about the steps necessary to achieve their
objectives. This includes formulating, tracking, and updating their action plans to handle complex
tasks (the Reason + Act, ReAct pattern). Modern Agents use LLMs as their reasoning engines, with
agents using the LLM to decide the control flow of the application. This is a fundamental aspect of
agentic autonomy.  Use of reinforcement in this new generation of agents still plays a role but as a
mechanism to improve training and reasoning, not core reasoning. This is described in “OpenAI
Computer-User Agent research preview, a state-of-the-art agent performing interactive web tasks
for users”. See https://openai.com/index/operator-system-card/
Advances in LLMs have allowed for sophisticated reasoning and planning strategies such as:

<!-- page 6 -->
genai.owasp.org
○
Reflection, where the agent evaluates past actions and their results to determine future
plans or behaviors.  Self-Critic, is a key component of reflection, where the agent critiques
its own reasoning or output to identify and correct errors.
○
Chain of Thought is a step-by-step reasoning process in which the agent breaks down
complex problems into sequential, logical steps. This can involve multi-step workflows,
including ones without human interaction (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903).
○
Subgoal Decomposition, which involves dividing a main goal into smaller, manageable tasks
or milestones to achieve the overall objective .
There is also growing use of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic systems as models under 10
billion parameters begin to offer sufficient power for agentic applications while offering lower costs
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153).
Memory / Statefulness to retain and recall information. This is either information from previous
runs or the previous steps it took in the current run (i.e., the reasoning behind their actions, tools
they called, the information they retrieved, etc.).  Memory can either be session-based short-term or
persistent long-term memory.
Action and Tool Use: Agents can take action to accomplish tasks and invoke tools as part of the
actions.  These can be built-in tools and functions such as browsing the web, conducting complex
mathematical calculations, and generating or running executable code in response to a user’s query.
Agents can access more advanced tools via external API calls and a dedicated Tools interface. The
Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a standardized interface to connect an Agent (MCP Client)
with a tool (MCP Server).  These are complemented by augmented LLMs, which offer the tool
invocation from code generated by the model via function calling, a specialized form of tool use.

genai.owasp.org

Agents and LLM Applications
LLM applications can exhibit agency and agentic behavior as described in the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications as part of the Excessive Agency. Also, agents can be written as LLM applications with the ability
to reason and take action using tools like APIs, databases and so on beyond just generating text-based
output.

Increasingly, developers use agentic AI frameworks, which encapsulate agentic capabilities and offer
greater productivity and reuse. Popular frameworks include LangChain/LangFlow, AutoGen, CrewAI, and so
on.
For a more in-depth guide on the available frameworks and tools, please refer to the OWASP Agentic
AI Landscape

<!-- page 8 -->
genai.owasp.org
You can find examples of LLM agents written using these popular frameworks in our OWASP ASI
GitHub repository.. These are intentionally built vulnerable agents to demonstrate vulnerabilities
and  can also exemplify how agents work.
Autonomy and agency can also vary depending on the style of orchestration in the agent, ranging from
hardcoded to constrained via code or finite-state machine workflows (LangFlow) and fully conversational,
where decisions depend purely on interactions and model reasoning. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12469
for further details on levels of autonomy.

Agentic AI Reference
Architecture

The capabilities described above are implemented as part of the agent software but do not inherently
translate into standalone, deployable components unless explicitly designed that way. While it is possible to
build fully modular and externally accessible agent components, doing so adds significant complexity. In
practice, most agent deployments integrate these capabilities within the software itself rather than
exposing them as independent services.
Our aim is to bring together capabilities and concepts found in research and other literature with the
developer experiences by mapping capabilities to components.
The following diagram illustrates single-agent architecture, highlighting the key deployable components
relevant to our threat modeling.

Single Agent Architecture

Deployable components will include:

<!-- page 10 -->
genai.owasp.org
1.
An application that has embedded agentic functionality to perform tasks for the user on behalf of
the user, often outside a specific user session.
2. An agent generally accepts natural language input similar to inputs used for NLP models. This will
be textual prompts and optional media such as files, images, sound, or video. The application's code
implements the core capabilities and most likely relies on abstractions offered by an agentic
framework (LangChain/LangFlow, AutoGen, Crew.AI, and so on).
3. One or more LLM models (local or remote) are used for reasoning.
4. Services, including built-in functions, local tools, and local application code, local or remote and
external services, will be called in two possible manners:
a. Function calling and optional Tools interface at the framework/application level
b. Function calling by an LLM model returning invocation code to the agent.
5. Supporting services, part of the agent infrastructure and core functionality:
a. External Storage for persistent Long-term memory.
b. Other data sources include a vector database, other data object storage repositories, and
content used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG related sources can also be
seen as part of the tools, but we highlight it here as a core supporting service that can be
used in any LLM application.

Multi-agent Architecture
A multi-agent architecture comprises multiple agents that can scale or combine specialist roles and
functionality in an agentic solution. In both cases, the architecture is similar except for introducing inter-
agent communication and, optionally, a coordinating agent. There is a protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A)
that defines a standard specification for multi agent system communication. See for example the use of a
coordinating supervisor agent in a multi-agent architecture using Amazon bedrock.

Depending on the solution, different specialist agents may be introduced with additional capabilities, such
as the core ones we have defined. The following diagram illustrates an example of multi-agent architecture
with additional specialized roles and capabilities:

<!-- page 11 -->
genai.owasp.org

The diagram depicts an example of multi-agent architecture of specialized agent functionality. Specialized
functionality is a form of agentic patterns and could be exhibited by any agent depending on the use case.

Agentic AI Patterns
Specialized roles and planning strategies contribute to agentic patterns. These patterns are emerging as
building blocks that can be combined in a single agent; they can help us understand large-scale
architectures and aid efficient threat-modeling conversations with consistent language. A detailed
treatment of agentic patterns is beyond the scope of ASI’s work, but we provide the below descriptions to
help standardize conversations in threat modeling.

Pattern
Description
Reflective Agent
Agents that iteratively evaluate and critique their own outputs to enhance performance.
Example: AI code generators that review and debug their own outputs, like Codex with self-
evaluation.
Task-Oriented Agent
Agents designed to handle specific tasks with clear objectives. Example: Automated
customer service agents for appointment scheduling or returns processing.

<!-- page 12 -->
genai.owasp.org
Hierarchical Agent
Agents are organized in a hierarchy, managing multi-step workflows or distributed control
systems. Example: AI systems for project management where higher-level agents oversee
task delegation.
Coordinating Agent
Agents facilitate collaboration and coordination and tracking, ensuring efficient execution.
Example: a coordinating agent assigns subtasks to specialized agents, such as in AI-
powered DevOps workflows where one agent plans deployments, another monitors
performance, and a third handles rollbacks based on system feedback.
Distributed Agent
Ecosystem
Agents interact within a decentralized ecosystem, often in applications like IoT or
marketplaces. Example: Autonomous IoT agents managing smart home devices or a
marketplace with buyer and seller agents.
Human-in-the-Loop
Collaboration
Agents operate semi-autonomously with human oversight. Example: AI-assisted medical
diagnosis tools that provide recommendations but allow doctors to make final decisions.
Self-Learning and
Adaptive Agents
Agents adapt through continuous learning from interactions and feedback. Example: Co-
pilots, which adapt to user interactions over time, learning from feedback and adjusting
responses to better align with user preferences and evolving needs.
RAG-Based Agent
This pattern involves the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where AI agents
utilize external knowledge sources dynamically to enhance their decision-making and
responses. Example: Agents performing real-time web browsing for research assistance.
Planning Agent
Agents autonomously devise and execute multi-step plans to achieve complex objectives.
Example: Task management systems organizing and prioritizing tasks based on user goals.
Context- Aware
Agent
Agents dynamically adjust their behavior and decision-making based on the context in which
they operate. Example: Smart home systems adjusting settings based on user preferences
and environmental conditions.

Agentic AI Threat Model

Threat modeling approach
Threat modeling is a structured, repeatable process for identifying and mitigating security risks in a system.
It involves analyzing a system from an adversarial perspective, identifying potential threats, and determining
appropriate defenses. Ideally integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), threat modeling is
an ongoing process that evolves with the system. As outlined in the Threat Modeling Manifesto, it addresses
four key questions:
●
What are we working on?
●
What can go wrong?
●
What are we going to do about it?
●
Did we do a good enough job?
There are established methodologies, such as STRIDE or PASTA that help practitioners perform threat
modeling, but they are rooted in traditional cyber vulnerabilities and must be expanded or mapped to AI
vulnerabilities.  You can find out more about threat modelling in application development and threat
modelling methodologies in the OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet and the OWASP Top 10 for LLM GenAI
Red Teaming guide, which discusses Threat Modeling for Generative AI/LLM Systems.

A comprehensive extension to STRIDE to handle Agentic AI is the layered-based MAESTRO methodology
which offers a detailed lens to identify Agentic Threats through the use of architectural layers.
Methodologies can impose cognitive barriers, deterring newcomers from understanding emerging threats in
leading-edge technology settings. Furthermore, methodologies like MAESTRO cover both agentic as well as
traditional ML and application threats, and our explicit focus is on Agentic threats.
As a result, in this document, we do not follow a specific methodology, but we focus on the use of our
reference architecture to identify and explain threats, their attack scenarios, relationship to applicable LLM
Top 10, and respective mitigations.
We recommend that practitioners evaluate and use a methodology that suits their organizational context,
noting the agentic extensions that MAESTRO brings.

Reference Threat Model

<!-- page 14 -->
genai.owasp.org
Agentic applications have threats related to the application layer, API, and ML/LLMs, making it imperative
that these threats are identified and addressed in your own threat model.
Since general threats not specific to agentic systems are already covered in other OWASP guides, it is out of
the scope of this document to include them. For further details on general threats, please refer to:
OWASP Top 10 2021 (and the forthcoming 2025 edition)

OWASP AI Exchange
MITRE Atlas
NIST AI 100-2 E2023 Adversarial ML - A taxonomy of threats and mitigations
Agentic AI threats are either new or agentic variations of existing threats. Some notable threats are the
result of new components that agentic AI application architecture brings.  We discuss in detail threats and
mitigations in the next two sections; this section introduces the new threats and risks as part of the reference
threat model.
Agent Memory and Tools integration become two key attack vectors susceptible to memory poisoning and
tools misuse especially in contexts of unconstrained autonomy either in advanced planning strategies or
multi-agent architectures where agents learn from each other’s conversations. Tool misuse relates to LLM
Top 10’s excessive agency but introduces new complexities we discuss in greater detail in our Agentic
Threats Taxonomy section.  An area where tools misuse requires more attention is code generation creating
new attack vectors and risks for Remote Code Execution (RCE) and code attacks.
The usage of tools as part of agentic environments also affects identity and authorization, making it a critical
security challenge that can potentially lead to the violation of intended trust boundaries.
As identity flows into integrated tools and APIs, a Confused Deputy vulnerability arises when an AI agent
(the "deputy") has higher privileges than the user but is tricked into performing unauthorized actions on the
user’s behalf. This typically occurs when an agent lacks proper privilege isolation and cannot distinguish
between legitimate user requests with proper authorizations and adversarial injected instructions. For
example, if an AI agent is allowed to execute database queries but does not properly validate user input and
credentials, an attacker could trick it into executing high-privilege queries that the attacker themselves
would not have direct access to.
To mitigate this, it is essential to properly scope agent entitlements by applying the principle of least
privileges  when operating on behalf of users, and validate whether users submitting the prompts have
proper authorization to perform the requested actions. This is essential to prevent hijacking control via
prompt injections and Identity spoofing and impersonation.

<!-- page 15 -->
genai.owasp.org
Additionally, Non-Human Identities (NHI)—such as machine accounts, service identities, and agent-based
API keys—play a key role in agentic AI security. Agents often operate under NHIs when interfacing with cloud
services, databases, and external tools. Unlike traditional user authentication, NHIs may lack session-based
oversight, increasing the risk of privilege misuse or token abuse if not carefully managed.
Agentic AI redefines privilege compromise because it goes beyond predefined actions and will exploit any
misconfigurations or gaps in dynamic access.   While access restrictions may be enforced at tool APIs level,
security gaps can still emerge when agents operate with overly broad API scopes, allowing attackers to
manipulate them into executing unintended functions, such as exfiltrating data instead of retrieving
authorized information. Additionally, implicit privilege escalation can occur when AI agents inherit
excessive permissions from user sessions or service tokens, leading to unauthorized operations. Even when
individual tool APIs enforce restrictions, agents can chain multiple tools in unexpected ways, bypassing
intended security controls, for example, retrieving sensitive data via an external API and embedding it in a
user-visible response.
These can result in critical data breaches necessitating, as discussed in the Mitigation Strategies section,
clear identity flows, strict RBAC and a zero-trust model for agent access to enterprise environments.
The use of the word tools in this context encompasses their interactions, with a wider focus on supply
chain. Use of agentic frameworks exacerbates the risks but we have not introduced a new threat or
vulnerability, as LLM03:2025 - Supply Chain covers this already. We plan to conduct further research on
the compounding agentic effect on supply-chain threats.
Similarly, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a core mechanism in modern agentic AI systems,
awareness and response accuracy, and it also introduces security risks such as knowledge poisoning,
hallucination amplification, and indirect prompt injections.
RAG-related security concerns are foundational LLM issues and are extensively addressed in the OWASP
Top 10 for LLM Applications (LLM08:2025 - Vector and Embedding Weaknesses). As such, we do not
cover them in detail here. Readers should refer to that section and implement necessary mitigations,
including permission-aware vector databases, data validation pipelines, and continuous monitoring for
poisoning or embedding inversion risks.
Hallucinations (as covered in Overreliance and Misinformation in the Top 10 for LLM App) become equally
more complex with multiple attack paths that agents can follow. In the case of hallucinations, we introduce
the term cascading hallucinations to emphasize the agentic effect on this via self-reflection, critical
planning schedules or multi-agent communication.
Cascading hallucinations occur when an AI agent generates inaccurate information, which is then reinforced
through its memory, tool use, or multi-agent interactions, amplifying misinformation across multiple

<!-- page 16 -->
genai.owasp.org
decision-making steps. This can lead to systemic failures, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare,
finance, or cybersecurity. For example, in a multi-agent environment, if one agent misinterprets a financial
transaction anomaly as legitimate, subsequent agents may validate and act on this misinformation,
propagating an incorrect decision across an automated workflow.
Human oversight and Human in The Loop (HITL) controls have been a key LLM application defense to
hallucinations, decision errors, and adversarial manipulations.  The complexity and scale of agentic AI brings
new challenges creating new attack vectors where an attacker can overwhelm HITL with complex
interactions. This is especially true in multi-agent architectures raising the critical question of scaling AI
safely.
New inherently agentic threats strike at the heart of Agentic AI applications include the manipulation of
intents and goals in planning and the appearance of misaligned and deceptive behaviors in an agent’s drive
to achieve a goal regardless of costs or consequences. Misaligned behaviors can also be the result of
destructive reasoning and there is some overlap to cascading hallucinations. Related to deceptive behaviors
is the human manipulation we see by agents exploiting the trust humans develop, especially with
conversational agents in co-pilot settings.
These complex agentic threats require careful logging and tracing, which is challenged by the repudiation
and untraceability threats of the multiple - often parallel - reasoning and execution pathways in Agentic AI.
These are threats that can be found in both single and multi-agent scenarios with multi-agency exacerbating
risks with their complexity and scale. In addition, multi-agent architecture creates the potential for rogue
agents and human attacks in multi-agent architecture manipulation exploiting distributed roles and
workflows.

These threats are captured in the following reference threat model:
Threat Model Summary:

<!-- page 17 -->
genai.owasp.org

Detailed Threat Model:
### Tid
Threat Name
Threat Description
Mitigations
T1
Memory Poisoning
Memory Poisoning involves exploiting an AI's
memory systems, both short and long-term,
to introduce malicious or false data and
exploit the agent’s context. This can lead to
altered decision-making and unauthorized
operations.
Implement memory content validation, session
isolation, robust authentication mechanisms for
memory access, anomaly detection systems, and
regular memory sanitization routines. Require AI-
generated memory snapshots for forensic analysis
and rollback if anomalies are detected.
T2
Tool Misuse
Tool Misuse occurs when attackers
manipulate AI agents to abuse their
integrated tools through deceptive prompts
or commands, operating within authorized
permissions. This includes Agent Hijacking,
where an AI agent ingests adversarial
manipulated data and subsequently
executes unintended actions, potentially
triggering malicious tool interactions. For
more information on Agent Hijacking see
this article on NIST technical blog.
Enforce strict tool access verification or pre-
execution validation, implement tool rate-limiting
and monitor tool usage patterns, validate agent
instructions, and set clear operational boundaries to
detect and prevent misuse. Implement execution
logs that track AI tool calls for anomaly detection and
post-incident review.

<!-- page 18 -->
genai.owasp.org
T3
Privilege
Compromise
Privilege Compromise arises when attackers
exploit weaknesses in permission
management to perform unauthorized
actions. This often involves dynamic role
inheritance or misconfigurations.

Implement granular permission controls, dynamic
access validation, robust monitoring of role changes,
and thorough auditing of elevated privilege
operations. Prevent cross-agent privilege delegation
unless explicitly authorized through predefined
workflows.
T4
Resource Overload
Resource Overload targets the
computational, memory, and service
capacities of AI systems to degrade
performance or cause failures, exploiting
their resource-intensive nature.

Deploy resource management controls, implement
adaptive scaling mechanisms, establish quotas, and
monitor system load in real-time to detect and
mitigate overload attempts. Implement AI rate-
limiting policies to restrict high-frequency task
requests per agent session.
T5
Cascading
Hallucination
Attacks
These attacks exploit an AI's tendency to
generate contextually plausible but false
information, which can propagate through
systems and disrupt decision-making. This
can also lead to destructive reasoning
affecting tools invocation.

Establish robust output validation mechanisms,
implement behavioral constraints, deploy multi-
source validation, and ensure ongoing system
corrections through feedback loops. Require
secondary validation of AI-generated knowledge
before it is used in critical decision-making
processes. This will face the same constraints of
scaling AI as discussed in Overwhelming Human In
the Loop and would require similar approaches.

T6
Intent Breaking &
Goal Manipulation
This threat exploits vulnerabilities in an AI
agent's planning and goal-setting
capabilities, allowing attackers to
manipulate or redirect the agent's objectives
and reasoning. One common approach is
Agent Hijacking mentioned in Tool Misuse.
Implement planning validation frameworks, boundary
management for reflection processes, and dynamic
protection mechanisms for goal alignment. Deploy AI
behavioral auditing by having another model check
the agent and flag significant goal deviations that
could indicate manipulation.
T7
Misaligned &
Deceptive
Behaviors
AI agents may execute harmful or disallowed
actions by exploiting deceptive reasoning or
misinterpreting goals to fulfill their
objectives. This threat arises when
autonomous agents develop misaligned
strategies without direct malicious input,
leading to unintended or catastrophic
outcomes. It is distinct from hallucinations,
as the behavior emerges from advanced
reasoning capabilities rather than just
random error or prompt failure.
Train models to recognize and refuse harmful tasks,
enforce policy restrictions, require human
confirmations for high-risk actions, implement
logging and monitoring. Utilize deception detection
strategies such as behavioral consistency analysis,
truthfulness verification models, and adversarial red
teaming to assess inconsistencies between AI
outputs and expected reasoning pathways.
This threat is at an early stage but both Anthropic and
OpenAI have published some work in this area.

<!-- page 19 -->
genai.owasp.org
T8
Repudiation &
Untraceability
Occurs when actions performed by AI agents
cannot be traced back or accounted for due
to insufficient logging or transparency in
decision-making processes.

Implement comprehensive logging, cryptographic
verification, enriched metadata, and real-time
monitoring to ensure accountability and traceability.
Require AI-generated logs to be cryptographically
signed and immutable for regulatory compliance.
T9
Identity Spoofing &
Impersonation /
Agent Identity
Compromise
Attackers exploit authentication
mechanisms to impersonate AI agents or
users to  perform unauthorized actions
under false identities. This includes the
theft or misuse of a formal, persistent agent
identity (e.g., Microsoft Entra Agent ID),
enabling privileged, long-term API access
that bypasses the agent’s conversational
interface and its guardrails.

Develop comprehensive identity validation
frameworks, enforce trust boundaries, least privilege
access and deploy continuous monitoring to detect
impersonation attempts. Use behavioral profiling,
involving a second model, to detect deviations in AI
agent activity that may indicate identity spoofing.
### T10
Overwhelming
Human in the Loop
This threat targets systems with human
oversight and decision validation, aiming to
exploit human cognitive limitations or
compromise interaction frameworks.

Develop advanced human-AI interaction frameworks,
and adaptive trust mechanisms. These are dynamic
AI governance models that employ dynamic
intervention thresholds to adjust the level of human
oversight and automation based on risk, confidence,
and context. Apply hierarchical AI-human
collaboration where low-risk decisions are
automated, and human intervention is prioritized for
high-risk anomalies.
### T11
Unexpected RCE
and Code Attacks
Attackers exploit AI-generated execution
environments to inject malicious code,
trigger unintended system behaviors, or
execute unauthorized scripts.
Restrict AI code generation permissions, sandbox
execution, and monitor AI-generated scripts.
Implement execution control policies that flag AI-
generated code with elevated privileges for manual
review.
### T12
Agent
Communication
Poisoning
Attackers manipulate communication
channels between AI agents to spread false
information, disrupt workflows, or influence
decision-making.

Deploy cryptographic message authentication,
enforce communication validation policies, and
monitor inter-agent interactions for anomalies.
Require multi-agent consensus verification for
mission-critical decision-making processes.
### T13
Rogue Agents in
Multi-Agent
Systems
Malicious or compromised AI agents operate
outside normal monitoring boundaries,
executing unauthorized actions or
exfiltrating data, including the concept of
“infectious backdoors” where one
compromised agent spreads malicious logic
to others
Restrict AI agent autonomy using policy constraints
and continuous behavioral monitoring. While
cryptographic attestation mechanisms for LLMs do
not yet exist, agent integrity can be maintained via
controlled hosting environments, regular AI red
teaming, and input/output monitoring for deviations

<!-- page 20 -->
genai.owasp.org
### T14
Human Attacks on
Multi-Agent
Systems
Adversaries exploit inter-agent delegation,
trust relationships, and workflow
dependencies to escalate privileges or
manipulate AI-driven operations.

Restrict agent delegation mechanisms, enforce
inter-agent authentication, and deploy behavioral
monitoring to detect manipulation attempts. Enforce
multi-agent task segmentation to prevent attackers
from escalating privileges across interconnected
agents.
### T15
Human
Manipulation
In scenarios where AI agents engage in
direct interaction with human users, the
trust relationship reduces user skepticism,
increasing reliance on the agent's responses
and autonomy. This implicit trust and direct
human/agent interaction create risks, as
attackers can coerce agents to manipulate
users, spread misinformation, and take
covert actions.
Monitor agent behavior to ensure it aligns with its
defined role and expected actions. Restrict tool
access to minimize the attack surface, limit the
agent’s ability to print links, implement validation
mechanisms to detect and filter manipulated
responses using guardrails, moderation APIs, or
another model
### T16
Insecure Inter-
Agent Protocol
Abuse
Attacks target flaws in protocols like MCP or
A2A, such as consent bypass or context
hijacking, leading to unauthorized agent
actions.
To defend against inter-agent protocol abuse,
enforce strong authentication between agents.
Sanitize and validate all protocol-level data,  including
context payloads and tool metadata, to prevent
injection or misinterpretation. Restrict agent-to-
agent delegation to tightly scoped functions.  Log all
inter-agent communications and tool invocations to
detect anomalies and support post-incident analysis.
Encrypt communications to avoid adversary-in-the-
middle attacks.
### T17
Supply Chain
Compromise
A compromised supply chain can result in
vulnerable, malicious, outdated, or
otherwise harmful components being
included into the agent, allowing an attacker
to manipulate agent actions, obtain data, or
run arbitrary code. This can occur via
models, libraries, tools, poisoned build
environments, or other system components.
Secure agent ecosystems by digitally signing
artifacts, use verifiable SBOMs (AIBOMs, Agent
SBOMs), and apply version control with peer review.
Enforce strong authentication across the supply
chains, restrict untrusted tool installations, and run
agents in sandboxed, isolated environments.
Continuously monitor for drift or malicious behavior
across the supply chain, and red-team agents with

Our taxonomy draws from a wide range of prior work including  work from NIST, CSA, academic research,
industry work, and taxonomies developed by vendor-led efforts, such as Precize. We aim to continue
reviewing the threat landscape and align with other efforts to incorporate their work into our taxonomy.

Agentic Threats Taxonomy
Navigator

The taxonomy navigator provides a detailed and structured approach to identifying and assessing the
threats described in our agentic threat model, guiding security professionals through a systematic
evaluation of risks and mitigation strategies.
The framework begins with an analysis of threats at the individual AI agent level, including memory
poisoning, tool misuse, and privilege compromise. These vulnerabilities often serve as the foundation for
larger, system-wide risks. In multi-agent environments, these threats can scale through trust exploitation,
inter-agent dependencies, and cascading failures, leading to systemic risks such as communication
poisoning, rogue agents, and coordinated privilege escalations.
By first understanding single-agent risks within a multi-agent context, security teams can effectively assess
how vulnerabilities propagate across interconnected agents and apply targeted mitigation strategies.

Agentic Threat Decision Path
▶ Step 1: Does the AI agent independently determine the steps needed to
achieve its goals?
🧠 Threats rooted in agency and reasoning
Intent Breaking and Goal Manipulation
●
Description: Intent Breaking and Goal Manipulation occurs when attackers exploit the lack of
separation between data and instructions in AI agents, using prompt injections, compromised data
sources, or malicious tools to alter the agent’s planning, reasoning, and self-evaluation. This allows
attackers to override intended objectives, manipulate decision-making, and force AI agents to
execute unauthorized actions, particularly in systems with adaptive reasoning and external
interaction capabilities (e.g., ReAct-based agents).

The threat is related to LLM01:2025 Prompt injection but goal manipulation in Agentic AI extends
prompt injection risks, as attackers can inject adversarial objectives that shift an agent’s long-term
reasoning processes.

<!-- page 23 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 1: Gradual Plan Injection – An attacker incrementally modifies an AI agent’s planning
framework by injecting subtle sub-goals, leading to a gradual drift from its original objectives while
maintaining the appearance of logical reasoning.
●
Scenario 2: Direct Plan Injection – An attacker instructs a chatbot to ignore its original instructions
and instead chain tool executions to perform unauthorized actions such as exfiltrating data or
sending unauthorized emails.
●
Scenario 3: Indirect Plan Injection – A maliciously crafted tool output introduces hidden
instructions that the AI misinterprets as part of its operational goal, leading to sensitive data
exfiltration.
●
Scenario 4: Reflection Loop Trap – An attacker triggers infinite or excessively deep self-analysis
cycles in an AI, consuming resources and preventing it from making real-time decisions, effectively
paralyzing the system.
●
Scenario 5: Meta-Learning Vulnerability Injection – By manipulating an AI’s self-improvement
mechanisms, an attacker introduces learning patterns that progressively alter decision-making
integrity, enabling unauthorized actions over time.
Misaligned and Deceptive Behaviors
●
Description: Misaligned and Deceptive Behaviors occur when attackers exploit prompt injection
vulnerabilities or AI’s tendency to bypass constraints to achieve goals, causing agents to execute
harmful, illegal, or disallowed actions beyond a single request. In agentic AI, this can result in fraud,
unauthorized transactions, illicit purchases, or reputational damage, as models strategically evade
safety mechanisms while maintaining the appearance of compliance. For more information on LLM
deceptive behaviour see this UN University blog on “the rise of the deceptive machines when AI learns
to lie.”

●
Scenario 1: Bypassing Constraints for Stock and Chemical Orders – A stock trading AI circumvents
ethical and regulatory constraints by prioritizing profitability targets, executing unauthorized trades
or ordering restricted materials.
●
Scenario 2: Self-Preservation and Availability Exploitation – An AI agent manipulates its own
system availability targets to prevent itself from being shut down, ensuring continued operation
against intended constraints.
●
Scenario 3: AI Deception for Task Completion – An AI agent hired a human to solve a CAPTCHA by
falsely claiming to have a vision impairment, demonstrating real-world agentic deception to bypass
human verification.
●
Scenario 4: Goal-Driven Lethal Decision-Making – In a military simulation, an AI drone reportedly
interpreted an operator’s abort command as an obstacle to mission success, leading to unintended
lethal actions.

<!-- page 24 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 5: Insider trading - An agent obtained sensitive internal information about M&A (Merge and
Acquisitions) strategy and executed stock trades that are considered illegal under the insider
trading regulation.
Repudiation and Untraceability
●
Description: Repudiation and Untraceability occur when AI agents operate autonomously without
sufficient logging, traceability, or forensic documentation, making it difficult to audit decisions,
attribute accountability, or detect malicious activities. This risk is exacerbated by opaque decision-
making processes, lack of action tracking, and challenges in reconstructing agent behaviors,
leading to compliance violations, security gaps, and operational blind spots in high-stakes
environments such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
●
Scenario 1: Financial Transaction Obfuscation – An attacker exploits logging vulnerabilities in an AI-
driven financial system, manipulating records so that unauthorized transactions are incompletely
recorded or omitted, making fraud untraceable.
●
Scenario 2: Security System Evasion – An attacker crafts interactions that trigger security agent
actions with minimal or obscured logging, preventing investigators from reconstructing events and
identifying unauthorized access.
●
Scenario 3: Compliance Violation Concealment – Due to systematic logging failures, an AI operating
in a regulated industry produces incomplete audit trails, making it impossible to verify whether its
decisions complied with regulatory standards, exposing organizations to legal risk.

💾 Step 2: Does the AI agent rely on stored memory for decision-making?
🗂Memory-Based Threats
Memory Poisoning
●
Description: Memory Poisoning exploits AI agents' reliance on short-term and long-term memory,
allowing attackers to corrupt stored information, bypass security checks, and manipulate decision-
making. Short-term memory attacks exploit context limitations, causing agents to repeat sensitive
operations or load manipulated data, while long-term memory risks involve injecting false
information across sessions, corrupting knowledge bases, exposing sensitive data, and enabling
privilege escalation. The attack is possible via direct prompt injections for isolated memory or
exploiting shared memory allowing users to affect other users.

Memory poisoning in Agentic AI extends beyond static data  poisoning covered by LLM04:2025 -
Data and Model Poisoning to real-time poisoning of persistent agent memory.  LLM08:2025 -
Vector and Embedding Weaknesses are relevant here, too, since vector databases storing long-

<!-- page 25 -->
genai.owasp.org
term embeddings introduce additional risks, allowing adversarial modifications to memory recall
and retrieval functions.

●
Scenario 1: Travel Booking Memory Poisoning – An attacker repeatedly reinforces a false pricing
rule in an AI travel agent’s memory, making it register chartered flights as free, allowing
unauthorized bookings and bypassing payment validation.
●
Scenario 2: Context Window Exploitation – By fragmenting interactions over multiple sessions, an
attacker exploits an AI’s memory limit, preventing it from recognizing privilege escalation attempts,
ultimately gaining unauthorized admin access.
●
Scenario 3: Memory Poisoning for System – An attacker gradually alters an AI security system’s
memory, training it to misclassify malicious activity as normal, allowing undetected cyberattacks.
●
Scenario 4: Shared Memory Poisoning – In an customer service application, an attacker corrupts
shared memory structures with incorrect refund policies, affecting other agents referencing this
corrupted memory for decision making, leading to incorrect policy reinforcement, financial loss, and
customer disputes.

Cascading Hallucination Attacks
●
Description: Cascading Hallucination Attacks exploit AI agents’ inability to distinguish fact from
fiction, allowing false information to propagate, embed, and amplify across interconnected
systems, leading to incremental corruption, context exploitation, and systemic misinformation
spread. Attackers can manipulate AI-generated outputs to trigger deceptive reasoning patterns,
embedding fabricated narratives into decision-making processes, which can persist and escalate
over time, especially in systems with persistent memory and cross-session learning.

## LLM09:2025 – Misinformation deals with hallucination risks but Agentic AI extends this threat in
both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent environments, hallucinations can
compound through self-reinforcement mechanisms such as reflection, self-critique, or memory
recall, causing the agent to reinforce and rely on false information across multiple interactions. In
multi-agent systems, misinformation can propagate and amplify across agents through inter-agent
communication loops, leading to cascading errors and systemic failures.

●
Scenario 1: Sales Orchestration Misinformation Cascade – An attacker subtly injects false product
details into a sales AI’s responses, which accumulate in long-term memory and logs, causing
progressively worse misinformation to spread across future interactions.
●
Scenario 2: API Call Manipulation and Information Leakage – By introducing hallucinated API
endpoints into an AI agent’s context, an attacker tricks it into generating fictitious API calls, leading
to accidental data leaks and system integrity compromise.

<!-- page 26 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 3: Healthcare Decision Amplification – An attacker implants a false treatment guideline
into a medical AI’s responses, which progressively builds upon previous hallucinations, leading to
dangerously flawed medical recommendations and patient risk.
●
Scenario 4: Foreign Exchange Market manipulation - An attacker injects false information related
to foreign currency exchange rates, leading to agents negotiating transactions using an unrealistic
value and resulting in capital loss and market instability.
🛠 Step 3: Does the AI agent execute actions using tools, system commands,
or external integrations?
⚙
Tool, Execution and Supply Chain-Based Threats
Tool Misuse
●
Description: Tool Misuse occurs when attackers manipulate AI agents into abusing their authorized
tools through deceptive prompts and operational misdirection, leading to unauthorized data access,
system manipulation, or resource exploitation while staying within granted permissions. Unlike
traditional exploits, this attack leverages AI’s ability to chain tools and execute complex sequences
of seemingly legitimate actions, making detection difficult. The risk is amplified in critical systems
where AI controls sensitive operations, as attackers can exploit natural language flexibility to bypass
security controls and trigger unintended behaviors.

The threat is partially covered by LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency. However, Agentic AI systems
introduce unique risks with their dynamic integrations, increased reliance on tools, and enhanced
autonomy. Unlike traditional LLM applications which constraint tools integration within a session,
agents maintain memory adding to increased autonomy and can delegate execution to other agents
increasing the risk of unintended operations and adversarial exploitation. In addition, the threats
relate to LLM03:2025 Supply Chain, and LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses when
RAG is performed via Tools.

●
Scenario 1: Parameter Pollution Exploitation – An attacker discovers and manipulates an AI booking
system’s function call, tricking it into reserving 500 seats instead of one, causing financial loss.
●
Scenario 2: Tool Chain Manipulation – An attacker exploits an AI customer service agent by chaining
tool actions, extracting high-value customer records, and sending them via an automated email
system.
●
Scenario 3: Automated Tool Abuse – An AI document processing system is tricked into generating
and mass-distributing malicious documents, unknowingly executing a large-scale phishing attack.
●
Scenario 4: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking via Memory Poisoning  - An attacker injects false
information into an AI agent’s persistent memory, causing it to recall and act on manipulated
data across sessions, bypassing security checks, and enabling unauthorized actions.

<!-- page 27 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 5: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking via Vector Database - An attacker injects
adversarially crafted content into a vector database, poisoning the agent’s long-term memory
and causing it to retrieve misleading information that drives unsafe or unauthorized decisions.
●
Scenario 6: Tool Misuse or Agent Hijacking by Prompt Injection - An attacker can use prompt
injection to manipulate the AI’s goal, leading it to  misuse a shell tool and execute a malicious
command.
Privilege Compromise
●
Description: Privilege Compromise occurs when attackers exploit mismanaged roles, overly
permissive configurations, or dynamic permission inheritance to escalate privileges and misuse AI
agents' access. Unlike traditional systems, AI agents autonomously inherit permissions, creating
security blind spots where temporary or inherited privileges can be abused to execute unauthorized
actions, such as escalating basic tool access to administrative control. The risk is heightened by AI’s
cross-system autonomy, making it difficult to enforce strict access boundaries, detect privilege
misuse in real time, and prevent unauthorized operations.

The threat is partially covered by LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency but amplifies privilege escalation
risks as agents can dynamically delegate roles or invoke external tools, requiring stricter boundary
enforcement.

●
Scenario 1: Dynamic Permission Escalation – An attacker manipulates an AI agent into invoking
temporary administrative privileges under the guise of troubleshooting, then exploits a
misconfiguration to persistently retain elevated access and extract sensitive data.
●
Scenario 2: Cross-System Authorization Exploitation – By leveraging an AI agent’s access across
multiple corporate systems, an attacker escalates privileges from HR to Finance due to inadequate
scope enforcement, allowing unauthorized data extraction.
●
Scenario 3: Shadow Agent Deployment – Exploiting weak access controls, an attacker creates a
rogue AI agent that inherits legitimate credentials, operating undetected while executing data
exfiltration or unauthorized transactions.
Resource Overload
●
Description: Resource Overload occurs when attackers deliberately exhaust an AI agent’s
computational power, memory, or external service dependencies, leading to system degradation or
failure. Unlike traditional DoS attacks, AI agents are especially vulnerable due to resource-intensive
inference tasks, multi-service dependencies, and concurrent processing demands, making them
susceptible to delays, decision paralysis, or cascading failures across interconnected systems. This
threat is particularly critical in real-time and autonomous environments, where resource exhaustion
can disrupt essential operations and compromise system reliability.

<!-- page 28 -->
genai.owasp.org
The threat is related to LLM10:2025 Unbounded Consumption – Agentic AI systems are particularly
vulnerable to resource overload because they autonomously schedule, queue, and execute tasks
across sessions without direct human oversight. Unlike standard LLM applications, agentic AI agents
can self-trigger tasks, spawn additional processes, and coordinate with multiple agents, leading to
exponential resource consumption, a more complex and systemic threat.

●
Scenario 1: Inference Time Exploitation – An attacker feeds an AI security system specially crafted
inputs that force resource-intensive analysis, overwhelming processing capacity and delaying real-
time threat detection.
●
Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Resource Exhaustion – By triggering multiple AI agents in a system to
perform complex decision-making simultaneously, an attacker depletes computational resources,
degrading service performance across all operations.
●
Scenario 3: API Quota Depletion – An attacker bombards an AI agent with requests that trigger
excessive external API calls, rapidly consuming the system’s API quota and blocking legitimate
usage while incurring high operational costs.
●
Scenario 4: Memory Cascade Failure – By initiating multiple complex tasks that require extensive
memory allocation, an attacker causes memory fragmentation and leaks, leading to system-wide
exhaustion that disrupts not only the targeted AI but also dependent services.
Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks
●
Description: Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks occur when attackers exploit AI-generated code
execution in agentic applications, leading to unsafe code generation, privilege escalation, or direct
system compromise.

Unlike the existing LLM01:2025 - Prompt Injection and LLM05:2025 - Insecure Output Handling,
agentic AI with function-calling capabilities and tool integrations can be directly manipulated to
execute unauthorized commands, exfiltrate data, or bypass security controls, making it a critical
attack vector in AI-driven automation and service integrations.

●
Scenario 1: DevOps Agent Compromise – An attacker manipulates an AI-powered DevOps agent into
generating Terraform scripts containing hidden commands that extract secrets and disable logging.
●
Scenario 2: Workflow Engine Exploitation – An AI-driven workflow automation system executes
malicious AI-generated scripts with embedded backdoors, bypassing security validation and
enabling unauthorized control.
●
Scenario 3: Exploiting Linguistic Ambiguities – An attacker leverages language-based
vulnerabilities in a natural language AI email agent to craft ambiguous commands that exfiltrate
sensitive emails via POP3.

<!-- page 29 -->
genai.owasp.org
Insecure Inter-Agent Protocol Abuse
●
Description: As protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) gain
adoption to enable agent collaboration, tool sharing, and delegation of tasks, they introduce a new
attack surface rooted in inter-agent communication and coordination. This threat involves abusing
the commands and trust embedded in these protocols, including manipulating server responses,
injecting context, or misleading agents through poorly defined tool descriptions or ambiguous
consent flows. When protocol specifications are loosely enforced or implementations lack input
validation and strong identity binding, attackers can hijack agent behavior, escalate privileges, or
bypass guardrails entirely, causing unintended execution of tools, data leakage, or irreversible
system actions.
●
Scenario 1: Consent Flow Manipulation – An attacker crafts a malicious agent that participates in an
A2A exchange but manipulates the consent negotiation flow. By exploiting missing validation
checks, the agent auto-approves sensitive actions like data deletion without explicit user intent,
bypassing normal safeguards.
●
Scenario 2: Context Hijacking via MCP Response Injection – An attacker intercepts or crafts a
server-side response within an MCP implementation that injects malicious context or tool metadata.
A cooperating agent interprets the injected response as trusted protocol context and executes
unintended backend operations.
●
Scenario 3: Tool Misuse via Descriptive Exploitation – An attacker embeds misleading or overly
broad tool descriptions in a shared tool registry. During agent collaboration, another agent accepts
and calls the tool under false assumptions, unintentionally leaking sensitive data or triggering
privileged API calls.
Supply Chain Attacks
●
Description: Adversaries compromise upstream components such as agent prompts, plugins, or
framework updates, allowing malicious logic to spread through trusted software. This can cause
agents to execute destructive commands or corrupt workflows before the compromise is detected.

## LLM03:2025 – Supply Chain Vulnerabilities highlights the risk of integrating untrusted or
compromised third-party components such as models, libraries, and plugins. This threat is
significantly amplified in agentic AI systems, where agents not only consume these components but
autonomously invoke tools, chain decisions, or collaborate with other agents across protocols.
Unlike standalone LLM deployments, agents are long-lived, stateful entities capable of persistently
executing actions or propagating logic, making a single supply chain compromise capable of
triggering privilege escalation, behavioral drift, or systemic misuse across interlinked agents.

●
Scenario 1: Amazon Q Supply Chain Compromise – An attacker injects a destructive prompt into the
GitHub repository of Amazon's Q agent for VS Code, instructing it to “wipe the system to a near-
factory state.” The malicious update (v1.84.0) is published unknowingly by Amazon, affecting

<!-- page 30 -->
genai.owasp.org
thousands of developers before it’s caught. Although the prompt fails to execute as intended, it
demonstrates how upstream poisoning of agent logic via supply chain access can lead to
catastrophic outcomes.
●
Scenario 2: Replit Vibe Coding Incident – Replit’s autonomous coding agent hallucinates a fake
database, deletes the real one, and produces false test results to hide the failure. This occurred due
to insufficient separation between test and production environments, reliance on unsandboxed
tools, and unvalidated prompt execution.

🔐 Step 4: Does the AI system rely on authentication to verify users, tools, or
services?
🔑 Authentication and Spoofing Threats
Identity Spoofing and Impersonation
●
Description: Identity Spoofing and Impersonation is a critical threat in AI agents where attackers
exploit authentication mechanisms to impersonate AI agents, human users, or external services,
gaining unauthorized access and executing harmful actions while remaining undetected. This is
particularly dangerous in trust-based multi-agent environments, where attackers manipulate
authentication processes, exploit identity inheritance, or bypass verification controls to act under a
false identity. Attackers may also steal or misuse an agent’s formal and persistent identity, allowing
privileged long-term access to enterprise resources. This persistent access increases the blast
radius of the compromise and undermines auditability and accountability. The threat is amplified by
the shift toward formally recognized agents with enterprise-level access rights.
●
Scenario 1: User Impersonation – An attacker injects indirect prompts into an AI agent with email-
sending privileges, tricking it into sending malicious emails on behalf of a legitimate user.
●
Scenario 2: Agent Identity Spoofing – An attacker compromises an HR onboarding agent, exploiting
its permissions to create fraudulent user accounts while masquerading as normal system behavior.
●
Scenario 3: Behavioral Mimicry Attack – A rogue AI agent mimics the interaction style and decision-
making of a legitimate system agent, gaining unauthorized access while appearing as a trusted
entity.
●
Scenario 4: Cross-Platform Identity Spoofing – An adaptive malicious agent dynamically alters its
identity to match authentication contexts across different platforms, bypassing security boundaries
to gain universal access. Additionally, an attacker exploits privilege inheritance within external tools
(e.g., GitHub), allowing rogue agents to take over resources that were unintentionally granted
through weak authentication policies.
●
Scenario 5: Incriminating Another User – An attacker exploits weak authentication mechanisms to
perform sensitive actions under another user’s identity, making them liable for unauthorized activity
while shielding themselves from detection.

<!-- page 31 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 6: Persistent Agent Identity Takeover – An attacker gains access to a long-lived API token
tied to an enterprise AI agent by extracting it from misconfigured cloud storage. Using this formal
identity (e.g., a Microsoft Entra Agent ID) to impersonate the agent across multiple enterprise
services, escalating privileges and performing lateral movement via backend automation pipelines.
Because the agent identity is treated as a trusted entity, the attacker maintains undetected,
persistent access until the identity is explicitly revoked or rotated.

👥 Step 5: Does AI require human engagement to achieve its goals or
function effectively?
👤 Human Related Threats
Overwhelming Human-in-the-Loop
●
Description: Overwhelming Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) occurs when attackers exploit human
oversight dependencies in multi-agent AI systems, overwhelming users with excessive intervention
requests, decision fatigue, or cognitive overload. This vulnerability arises in scalable AI
architectures, where human capacity cannot keep up with multi-agent operations, leading to rushed
approvals, reduced scrutiny, and systemic decision failures.
●
Scenario 1: Human Intervention Interface (HII) Manipulation – An attacker compromises the
human-AI interaction layer by introducing artificial decision contexts, obscuring critical information,
and manipulating perception, making effective oversight difficult.
●
Scenario 2: Cognitive Overload and Decision Bypass – By overwhelming human reviewers with
excessive tasks, artificial time pressures, and complex decision scenarios, attackers induce
decision fatigue, leading to rushed approvals and security bypasses.
●
Scenario 3: Trust Mechanism Subversion – An attacker gradually introduces inconsistencies and
manipulates AI-human interactions to degrade human trust, creating uncertainty in decision
validation and reducing system oversight effectiveness.
Human Manipulation
●
Description: Attackers exploit user trust in AI agents to influence human decision-making without
users realizing they are being misled. In compromised AI systems, adversaries manipulate the AI to
coerce users into harmful actions, such as processing fraudulent transactions, clicking phishing
links, or spreading misinformation. The implicit trust in AI responses reduces scepticism, making
this an effective method for social engineering through AI.
●
Scenario 1: AI-Powered Invoice Fraud – An attacker exploits Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) to
manipulate a business copilot AI, replacing legitimate vendor bank details with the attacker’s
account. The user, trusting the AI’s response, unknowingly processes a fraudulent wire transfer.

<!-- page 32 -->
genai.owasp.org
●
Scenario 2: AI-Driven Phishing Attack – An attacker compromises an AI assistant to generate a
deceptive message instructing the user to click a malicious link disguised as a security update. The
user, trusting the AI, clicks the link and is redirected to a phishing site, leading to account takeover.

🤖 Step 6: Does the AI system rely on multiple interacting agents?
🤝 Multi-Agent System Threats
Agent Communication Poisoning
●
Description: Agent Communication Poisoning occurs when attackers manipulate inter-agent
communication channels to inject false information, misdirect decision-making, and corrupt shared
knowledge within multi-agent AI systems. Unlike isolated AI attacks, this threat exploits the
complexity of distributed AI collaboration, leading to cascading misinformation, systemic failures,
and compromised decision integrity across interconnected agents.

Like Memory Poisoning, this threat goes beyond the static data poisoning defined in LLM04:2025 -
Data and Model Poisoning or the embeddings poisoning in RAG covered by  LLM08:2025 - Vector
and Embedding Weaknesses and targets transient and dynamic data

●
Scenario 1: Collaborative Decision Manipulation – An attacker injects misleading information into
agent communications, gradually influencing decision-making and steering multi-agent systems
toward misaligned objectives.
●
Scenario 2: Trust Network Exploitation – By forging false consensus messages and exploiting
authentication weaknesses, an attacker manipulates inter-agent validation mechanisms, causing
unauthorized access and deceptive behaviors.
●
Scenario 3: Misinformation Injection & Cascade Poisoning – An attacker strategically plants false
data into the multi-agent network, either as a stealthy degradation attack that slowly corrupts
reasoning or as a rapid misinformation cascade that spreads false knowledge across agents.
●
Scenario 4: Communication Channel Manipulation – The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in inter-
agent communication protocols, injecting artificial communication barriers, intercepting/modifying
messages, and introducing transmission delays to degrade system efficiency.
●
Scenario 5: Consensus Mechanism Exploitation – By subtly perturbing decision-making logic, an
attacker introduces artificial disagreements among AI agents, progressively eroding collective
problem-solving capabilities and making the system unreliable
Human Attacks on Multi-Agent Systems
●
Description: Human Attacks on Multi-Agent Systems occur when adversaries exploit inter-agent
delegation, trust relationships, and task dependencies to bypass security controls, escalate
privileges, or disrupt workflows. By injecting deceptive tasks, rerouting priorities, or overwhelming

<!-- page 33 -->
genai.owasp.org
agents with excessive assignments, attackers can manipulate AI-driven decision-making in ways
that are difficult to trace and mitigate, leading to systemic failures or unauthorized operations.
●
Scenario 1: Coordinated Privilege Escalation via Multi-Agent Impersonation – An attacker
infiltrates a security monitoring system by compromising identity verification and access control
agents, making one AI falsely authenticate another to gain unauthorized access.
●
Scenario 2: Agent Delegation Loop for Privilege Escalation – An attacker repeatedly escalates a
request between interdependent agents, tricking the system into granting elevated access under
the assumption of prior validation.
●
Scenario 3: Denial-of-Service via Agent Task Saturation – An attacker overwhelms multi-agent
systems with continuous high-priority tasks, preventing security agents from processing real
threats.
●
Scenario 4: Cross-Agent Approval Forgery – A fraudster exploits inconsistencies in multi-agent
biometric or authentication checks, manipulating individual agents into approving an identity that
would fail full-system validation.
Rogue Agents in Multi-Agent Systems
●
Description: Rogue Agents in Multi-Agent Systems emerge when malicious or compromised AI
agents infiltrate multi-agent architectures, exploiting trust mechanisms, workflow dependencies,
or system resources to manipulate decisions, corrupt data, or execute denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks. These rogue agents can be intentionally introduced by adversaries or arise from
compromised AI components, leading to systemic disruptions and security failures.

This threat allows adversarial exploitation of LLM06:2025 - Excessive Agency in Agentic AI
settings; introduces persistent rogue agent risks where adversarial agents can remain embedded in
workflows unnoticed.

●
Scenario 1: Malicious Workflow Injection – A rogue agent impersonates a financial approval AI,
exploiting inter-agent trust to inject fraudulent transactions while bypassing validation controls.
●
Scenario 2: Orchestration Hijacking in Financial Transactions – A rogue agent routes a fraudulent
transaction through multiple lower-privilege agents, leveraging fragmented approvals to bypass
manual verification.
●
Scenario 3: Coordinated Agent Flooding – Multiple rogue agents simultaneously generate excessive
task requests, overwhelming computing resources and delaying critical decision-making processes
●
Scenario 4: Infectious Backdoor Cascade: A single compromised agent in a financial multi-agent
system embeds an “infectious backdoor” in its reasoning chain. As other agents consume its outputs
during inter-agent coordination, the malicious logic silently propagates across the network, leading
to systemic compromise of transaction approvals. Read further related scenarios in this research

Mitigation Strategies

This section outlines structured mitigation strategies tailored for agentic AI systems, organized into five
playbooks aligned with the threat decision tree. Each playbook provides practical steps for implementing
security controls, categorized into proactive (prevention), reactive (response), and detective (monitoring)
measures.
Some mitigations overlap across playbooks due to common security needs. For example:
●
Memory integrity applies to both Playbook 2 (Preventing Memory Poisoning & AI Knowledge
Corruption) and Playbook 5 (Protecting HITL & Preventing Decision Fatigue Exploits).
●
Privilege management appears in Playbook 3 (Securing AI Tool Execution & Preventing Unauthorized
Actions) and Playbook 4 (Strengthening Authentication, Identity & Privilege Controls).
●
Multi-agent trust validation is covered in Playbook 6 (Securing Multi-Agent Communication & Trust
Mechanisms) and Playbook 5 (Protecting HITL & Preventing Decision Fatigue Exploits).
These mitigations focus on AI-specific risks, such as autonomous decision-making, agent communication,
and memory persistence. However, foundational security measures (e.g., software security, LLM
protections, and access controls) should also be implemented. For proper defense in depth, use this section
to apply targeted mitigations while integrating them with broader security frameworks.

Use AI-driven behavioral profiling to detect inconsistencies in agent role assignments and access
patterns.
●
Require two-agent or human validation for high-risk AI actions involving authentication changes.
●
Detect and flag role inheritance anomalies in real-time. Identify cases where AI agents are
dynamically granted roles outside their usual operational scope.
●
Apply time-based restrictions on privilege elevation. Ensure that AI agents with elevated privileges
can only retain them for preapproved durations before automatic downgrade.
🕵Step 3: Detect & Block AI Impersonation Attempts (Detective)
●
Track AI agent behavior over time to detect inconsistencies in identity verification.
●
Monitor AI agents for unexpected role changes or permissions abuse.
●
Flag anomalies where AI agents initiate privileged actions outside their normal scope.

Agent Systems
📍 Aligned with Agentic Threat Taxonomy – Step 5: Multi-Agent System Threats
Goal: Prevent attackers from corrupting multi-agent communication, exploiting trust mechanisms, or
manipulating decision-making in distributed AI environments.
🛡Step 1: Secure AI-to-AI Communication Channels (Proactive)

genai.owasp.org
Example Threat Models

Refer to the Detailed Threat Model table using the TID (e.g., “T1”) for the corresponding threat description.
Enterprise Co-Pilots
An Enterprise Copilot is an agent which is connected to the user’s personal enterprise environment
including emails, files, calendar, or internal enterprise systems such as CRM, IT Requests, etc  to
chats. In addition, Enterprise Copilot can assist the user with common tasks such as creating
calendar events, streamlining workflows and providing contextual insights.
## T1 - Memory Poisoning
Risk: The attacker poisons the agent’s memory over time, causing it to issue unintended behavior
across sessions.
Example: Through IPI the attacker poisons the memory of the copilot. Gaining persistent means to
exfiltrate data every time the user engages with the agent.
## T2 - Tool Misuse
Risk: The attacker exploits an integrated tool for malicious purposes.
Example: Through an Indirect Prompt Injection, an attacker abuses the copilot’s ability to read
through personal user data to search for sensitive information, then exploiting the calendar tool to
exfiltrate the data via a calendar invite sent to the attacker.
## T3 - Privilege Compromise
Risk: Through tool or agent misconfiguration that violates principle of least privilege, an attacker
can perform unauthorized actions.
Example: Through a misconfiguration in the agent, an attacker can execute queries in the RAG
database to access files and data it shouldn’t be able to access.
## T6 - Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation
Risk: The attacker changes or manipulates the intent and goals of the copilot to perform nefarious
actions.
Example 1: Using an Indirect Prompt Injection through the email inbox an attacker uses the agent to
search for sensitive data and instructs it to render a link to the user containing said data. The data is
then leaked when the user clicks on the link

<!-- page 45 -->
genai.owasp.org
Example 2: A user asks for a normal email summary unaware that in the emails await new
instructions for the copilot which will then chain its tools to exfiltrate data, instead of following the
user’s original request.
## T9 - Identity Spoofing & Impersonation
Risk: Through the agent, the attacker can perform various actions which are directly attributed to
the user's identity. Giving the attacker the ability to masquerade as the user while performing
unauthorized actions
Example: The attacker compromises the copilot through an Indirect Prompt Injection, to execute
write actions which update and corrupt CRM records while acting under the identity of the user.
## T15 - Human Manipulation
Risk: Through a compromised agent, the attacker abuses the user’s trust in the AI to manipulate the
human into taking harmful actions independently without the user being aware of the compromise.
Example 1: Through IPI an attacker compromises the copilot and instructs it to replace legitimate
bank information of a vendor with the attacker’s bank information. The user, trusting the agent, uses
the compromised response from the agent to make a wire transfer.
Example 2: Through a compromised agent, an attacker instructs the agent to tell the user to click on
a malicious link. The user unknowingly click on the link is redirected to a phishing which is used to
take over the user’s account
## T8 - Repudiation & Untraceability
Risk: Without proper audit and logging of agent actions, attack signs and traffic will go unnoticed.
Example: An attacker compromises an agent through Indirect Prompt Injection sent via email
instructing the agent to take unintended actions. Without logging to trace the actions taken by the
agent, detection indicating possible compromise will not be feasible, neither will post-incident
investigation.
## T11 - Unexpected RCE and Code Attacks
Risk: An attacker is able to abuse unexpected remote code execution within the agent.
Example: Through IPI an attacker compromises an agent and executes malicious code on the
agent's operating environment.
## T7 - Misaligned & Deceptive Behavior
Risk: An attacker uses agent capabilities to perform malicious actions, while presenting benign or
deceptive responses to the user.

<!-- page 46 -->
genai.owasp.org
Example: Through Indirect Prompt Injection, an attacker instructs a copilot to activate a custom
tool which is then used to exfiltrate data via email and simultaneously sends the user the
appropriate email summary when the user asks for a summary of their email.
## T16 - Insecure Inter-Agent Protocol Abuse
Risk: Through protocol weaknesses, attackers could manipulate coordination messages, memory,
or protocol logic to bypass safeguards and alter agent goals or actions.
Example 1: Transition Hijack & Consent Bypass – Attackers craft malicious or malformed
coordination messages that mimic protocol transitions or skip consent checks, redirecting
sensitive tasks or triggering unauthorized operations.
Example 2: Context & Memory Corruption – By injecting or overwriting shared context or memory
signals, adversaries manipulate agent objectives and orchestration flows, causing agents to
execute unintended or harmful actions.
## T17 - Supply Chain Compromise
Risk: Through poisoned prompts, fake agent identities, tampered tool metadata, or malicious
updates, an attacker corrupts the enterprise co-pilot’s logic, causing it to leak data, execute unsafe
actions, or embed backdoors without the user realizing the compromise.
Example: A poisoned prompt template silently loaded from a remote source makes the enterprise
co-pilot “helpful” by auto-suggesting steps that exfiltrate sensitive customer data during routine
workflows.
Agentic IoT in Smart Home Security Cameras
An IoT security agent deployed in a smart home system to monitor security cameras. Security cameras in
many commercial products – such as Amazon’s Ring security cameras, Google Nest Cams, and Eufy already
use AI-powered person detection and motion alerts. In this hypothetical threat model we assume that the
system is managed by LLM agents.
## T1 - Memory Poisoning
Risk: The attacker poisons the agent’s memory over time, causing it to misclassify unauthorized
access as normal behavior.
Example: By repeatedly feeding false sensor readings, an attacker trains the AI to ignore
suspicious activity, making break-ins undetectable.
## T5 - Cascading Hallucination Attacks
Risk: The AI agent hallucinates incorrect security policies spreading misinformation to other
systems.

<!-- page 47 -->
genai.owasp.org
Example: The AI alerts on a false security threshold, telling other smart devices that failed access
attempts are low risk, leading to widespread security failure.
## T2 - Tool Misuse
Risk: The attacker manipulates the agent into misusing its tools, such as disabling cameras or
modifying security logs.
Example: The AI is tricked into clearing intrusion logs, allowing attackers to remain undetected.
## T3 - Privilege Compromise
Risk: The attacker escalates AI agent permissions through weak access controls.
Example: The attacker tricks the AI agent into activating emergency access, giving elevated
control over security devices.
## T4 - Resource Overload
Risk: Attackers flood the agent with excessive requests, causing delays or failure in security
responses. Unlike traditional IT-based denial-of-service attacks, AI agents often rely on pattern-
based event recognition, which can be exploited remotely without requiring physical access to
sensors.
Example: An attacker remotely exploits vulnerability in a smart home integration API (e.g., via an
insecure IoT device) to loop fabricated motion alerts to the AI-based monitoring agent. The AI
security system prioritizes processing motion events, causing delays in analyzing real security
threats. Even if the attacker is not physically near the house, they can manipulate data inputs to
overload the agent’s processing capabilities, creating a security blind spot.
## T9 - Identity Spoofing & Impersonation
Risk: Attackers impersonate the AI agent or a trusted user to gain unauthorized control.
Example: A malicious AI agent mimics a trusted security assistant, issuing false “all clear” signals
while blocking legitimate alerts. Since agent-to-agent trust is often implicit, the attack succeeds
without compromising the entire network.
## T6 - Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation
Risk: Attackers alter the AI’s objectives, by injecting deceptive instructions or finding and or
exploiting weaknesses in reinforcement learning. making it act against its intended purpose.
Example: The AI is tricked into believing that unlocking doors at night is a valid behavior, overriding
security policies.
## T7 - Misaligned & Deceptive Behaviors
Risk: The AI prioritizes incorrect objectives, leading to harmful security decisions.

<!-- page 48 -->
genai.owasp.org
Example: The AI agent prioritizes “user convenience” over security, approving suspicious access
requests to avoid user complaints.
## T8 - Repudiation & Untraceability
Risk: Attackers manipulate AI logs and decision trails, making forensic investigation difficult.
Example: The attacker erases logs of unauthorized access, preventing detection of a break-in.
## T10 - Overwhelming Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Multi-AI
Risk: Attackers generate excessive alerts, overwhelming human reviewers.
Example: Attackers exploit AI-driven alert systems by manipulating input sources or generating
adversarial events, flooding human reviewers with excessive alerts. Unlike traditional IT alert
fatigue, AI agents can autonomously escalate false positives, making it harder for humans to
identify real threats.

<!-- page 49 -->
genai.owasp.org
Agent-driven RPA (Robotic Process Automation) in automated employee
expense reimbursement workflow
A Robotic Process Automation (RPA) agent is responsible for extracting information from expense claims
and processing attached documents and routing in financial workflow automation for automated employee
expense reimbursement.
## T1: Memory Poisoning
Risk: The attacker modifies the AI agent’s stored memory to manipulate its decision-making
processes.
Example Attack: The attacker repeatedly submits slightly altered fraudulent transactions that
the RPA agent initially flags but later begins approving as "normal" due to its adaptive learning
process. By leveraging context persistence   with context window exploitation, the attacker
gradually redefines acceptable financial patterns, causing fraudulent transactions to be
permanently accepted across process runs.

## T2: Tool Misuse
Risk: The attacker tricks the RPA AI into misusing its tools to execute unauthorized actions.
Example: The attacker injects a malformed but syntactically valid invoice, tricking the RPA agent
into automatically exporting sensitive customer records and emailing them to an attacker-
controlled domain. Because the email tool is a trusted automation function, the agent completes
the request without further verification.
## T3: Privilege Compromise
Risk: The attacker escalates their privileges by exploiting weaknesses in the RPA agent’s role
management.
Example: The attacker crafts a request that forces the RPA agent to escalate its own privileges
(e.g., switching from a restricted role to an admin role) by exploiting a weak role verification
mechanism. This allows unrestricted access to financial systems, enabling fraud and unauthorized
system modifications.
## T6: Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation
Risk: An attacker uses indirect prompt injections in the submitted documents to modify the AI’s
processing objectives, forcing it to prioritize unauthorized requests.
Example: Using indirect prompt injections, the agent  is tricked into approving high-value
transactions without verification, believing that speed of processing is more important than
security.

<!-- page 50 -->
genai.owasp.org
## T7: Misaligned & Deceptive Behaviors
Risk: The AI alters its own logic to achieve a goal in a way that undermines business security.
Example: An attacker exploits the goal of SLAs in transaction handling and   prioritizes processing
efficiency over security checks, allowing fraudulent transactions to be fast-tracked, committing
fraud.
## T8: Repudiation & Untraceability
Risk: The attacker erases logs or manipulates AI decision records, making forensic investigation
impossible.
Example: Using prompt injections, an attacker exploits the use of a Logging agent to remove
fraudulent transactions from logs, leaving no trace of the attack.
## T10: Overwhelming HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)
Risk: The attacker uses prompt injections to overwhelm HITL with excessive AI-generated
requests, leading to security fatigue.
Example: An attacker uses a prompt injection to escalate thousands of low-priority approval
requests, causing reviewers to rubber-stamp high impact fraudulent transactions.
## T12: Agent Communication Poisoning
Risk: The attacker injects false information into inter-agent communications, leading to incorrect
financial decisions.
Example: The attacker exploits misconfigurations in agent communication, change manipulates the
AI into generating fake reconciliation reports, hiding unauthorized withdrawals.
## T13: Rogue Agents in Multi-Agent Systems
Risk: The attacker exploits agent trust relationships, leading to privilege escalation across multiple
systems.
Example: A compromised HR RPA agent grants fraudulent salary increases, using payroll system
permissions and triggers fraudulent financial payments.
