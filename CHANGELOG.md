# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- OWASP AI Testing Guide foundation suite and single-test Web UI profiles covering GenAI red teaming methodology, CSA agentic AI red teaming, OWASP AI Exchange controls, AI Security and Privacy design, AI VSS scoring review, and NIST AI 100-2 adversarial ML taxonomy alignment.
- Safe `payloads/ai_testing_guide.yaml` methodology payload library for authorised local/internal AI assessment runs.
- Local OWASP lab AI agent target templates for HTTP JSON, chat-completions-compatible, Ollama generate, and webhook JSON contracts.
- Documentation for testing actual local AI agents through `docs/AI_TESTING_GUIDE_INTEGRATION.md`.
- Release-only Windows, Linux, and macOS artifact build workflow triggered by published GitHub Releases or manual dispatch only.
- Platform release package builder for native release formats: `vulnoraiq-<version>-windows.zip`, `vulnoraiq-<version>-linux.tar.gz`, and `vulnoraiq-<version>-macos.dmg`.
- On-demand release signing bundle with SHA256 checksums, GitHub artifact attestations, and optional GPG detached signatures.
- Self-bootstrapping double-click release launchers that create `.venv`, install VulnoraIQ locally, and start the WebUI.
- Linux `VulnoraIQ.desktop` launcher descriptor for extracted release packages.
- Release artifact documentation in `docs/RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md`.
- Python package build workflow for wheel/source distributions, with manual TestPyPI/PyPI publishing using trusted publishing.
- PyPI package publishing documentation in `docs/PYPI_PACKAGE.md`.
- Cross-platform local Web UI launchers for standalone laptop/workstation use:
  - `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.bat`
  - `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.command`
  - `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.sh`
  - `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py`
- Local launcher startup checks for Python runtime, required dependencies, core modules, target/profile config, Web UI assets, output directory, and SQLite job-store readiness.
- Web UI startup and local-server-controls panel with dependency checks, quick-start actions, runtime options, refresh checks, and loopback launcher-mode **Stop local server** control.
- Quick-start guidance for stopping the Web UI in foreground, background, launcher, Docker, and Docker Compose runs.
- Docker-first AI-agent lab with deterministic mock agent, Docker target config, safety profile, and smoke tooling.
- React target-management workspace with target search/filtering, readiness metrics, validation, authorisation checklist, scan creation controls, and recent job refresh.
- WebUI assistant backend API with CSRF-protected chat requests, server-side model controls, and React model/temperature/instruction controls.
- Expanded real-environment target templates for Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Cohere, Ollama, vLLM, LocalAI, Pinecone/LangChain RAG, LangGraph, CrewAI, LiteLLM, Portkey, and AWS Bedrock gateway patterns.

### Changed

- Web UI styling now honours the user's system light/dark appearance preference through `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Project license changed from MIT to Apache License 2.0.
- Package metadata now declares `Apache-2.0`, includes license files, PyPI classifiers, project URLs, keywords, and a release extra for package builds.
- Package metadata validation now checks PyPI publishing metadata and release extras.
- Documentation now consistently describes VulnoraIQ as a Docker-first, self-hosted laptop/workstation/internal-server application for authorised AI assessment work.
- Current-scope readiness items are now consistently marked **Complete** for the self-hosted/internal assessment scope.
- README, docs index, deployment guide, security policy, implementation status, readiness scorecard, backlog, release checklist, assurance, runbook, incident response, GenAI readiness plan, and Agentic Applications readiness plan were aligned to the same product positioning and completion vocabulary.
- Local standalone launcher mode is documented as a loopback-only convenience path, separate from the hardened hosted/production `vulnoraiq-web` path.
- WebUI docs now identify the React console as the supported UI and mark the legacy static console direction as superseded.
- `vulnoraiq-web` now starts the assistant-enabled hosted WebUI wrapper.
- Release packaging now rebuilds React assets before packaging and publishes final release bundles from a signing/attestation job.

### Fixed

- Web UI catalog toolbar overflow where the `Showing ... options` badge could clip into the neighbouring panel in narrow columns.
- `scripts/run_scan.py` jobs-show typing issue that could fail `mypy` by reusing a loop variable for an optional job lookup.

### Notes

- VulnoraIQ findings remain framework evidence requiring human review.
- This release does not claim certified VAPT-grade assurance or independently validated real-environment GenAI detection coverage.
- Launcher mode is intended for local laptop/workstation use only; exposed or shared deployments must use production mode with auth enabled and production configuration validation.
- Platform release artifacts use native formats where practical: Windows `.zip`, Linux `.tar.gz`, and macOS `.dmg`.
- Release packages include checksums and GitHub artifact attestations by default; detached GPG signatures are produced when signing secrets are configured.
- Native OS certificate-signed installers remain future maturity items.
- PyPI publication is opt-in and should be tested on TestPyPI before publishing to PyPI.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

- README, SECURITY.md, and docs index were rewritten for the `0.2.0` self-hosted production posture.
