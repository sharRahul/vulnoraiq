# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Quick-start guidance for stopping the Web UI in foreground, background, Docker, and Docker Compose runs.

### Changed

- Documentation now consistently describes VulnoraIQ as a self-hosted laptop/workstation/internal-server application for authorised AI assessment work.
- README, docs index, deployment guide, security policy, implementation status, readiness scorecard, backlog, release checklist, assurance, runbook, incident response, GenAI readiness plan, and Agentic Applications readiness plan were aligned to the same product positioning.

### Notes

- VulnoraIQ findings remain framework evidence requiring human review.
- This release does not claim certified VAPT-grade assurance or independently validated real-environment GenAI detection coverage.
