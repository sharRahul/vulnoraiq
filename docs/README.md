# VulnoraIQ Documentation

This folder contains the operational, security, production-readiness, assurance, OWASP, GenAI, Agentic, and MITRE ATLAS documentation for VulnoraIQ.

> **Current version:** `0.2.0`  
> **Current posture:** controlled internal enterprise production-readiness gate passed.  
> **Boundary:** not public internet-facing SaaS, not multi-tenant ready, and not certified VAPT-grade assurance.

## Production-readiness boundary

VulnoraIQ `0.2.0` may be described as:

> Controlled internal enterprise production-readiness gate passed.

It must **not** be described as:

- public SaaS ready
- multi-tenant ready
- unsupervised public internet ready
- certified VAPT-grade assurance
- a substitute for external penetration testing

## Current control summary

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | Fail-closed token auth; trusted reverse-proxy identity mode available |
| Production startup validation | Runtime checks via `webui/production_checks.py` and `scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py` |
| Web hardening | CSRF, request-size limits, rate limiting, security headers, structured errors |
| Persistence | SQLite default with WAL, foreign keys, busy timeout, schema versioning |
| Observability | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, auth-protected `/metrics`, structured JSON audit logs |
| Backup/restore | SQLite online backup and restore scripts with validation |
| Container | Non-root Dockerfile, `/data` volume, healthcheck, Docker Compose example |
| CI gates | Ruff, mypy, pytest, pip check, pip-audit, metadata validation, OWASP/ATLAS mapping validation, GenAI readiness validation, readiness validation, functional acceptance |
| Web UI test catalog | Categorized suites and single-test runnable profiles are visible from the dashboard |

## OWASP, GenAI, Agentic, and MITRE documentation

| Area | Document |
| --- | --- |
| OWASP LLM 2025 category specs | [`owasp/`](owasp/) |
| OWASP LLM production-readiness plan | [`owasp/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](owasp/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md) |
| OWASP to MITRE ATLAS crosswalk | [`owasp/OWASP_TO_MITRE_ATLAS_CROSSWALK.md`](owasp/OWASP_TO_MITRE_ATLAS_CROSSWALK.md) |
| GenAI Security implementation plan | [`genai/`](genai/) |
| GenAI Security production-readiness plan | [`genai/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](genai/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md) |
| GenAI Security scenario manifest | [`../benchmarks/fixtures/genai/scenarios.yaml`](../benchmarks/fixtures/genai/scenarios.yaml) |
| GenAI Security readiness validator | [`../scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py`](../scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py) |
| Agentic Applications implementation plan | [`agentic/`](agentic/) |
| Agentic Applications source-doc production-readiness plan | [`agentic/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](agentic/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md) |
| Agentic Applications repo phase gate | [`AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md) |
| OWASP source document review index | [`owasp-documents/`](owasp-documents/) |
| MITRE ATLAS AI planning matrix | [`MITRE_ATLAS_AI_MATRIX.md`](MITRE_ATLAS_AI_MATRIX.md) |
| MITRE ATLAS mapping notes | [`mitre-atlas-mapping.md`](mitre-atlas-mapping.md) |

The OWASP, GenAI, Agentic, and MITRE documents are implementation references and planning records. They should not be interpreted as proof that every mapped technique has production-validated active detection coverage.

## Source document review status

The uploaded source PDFs have been reviewed for category extraction and planning alignment:

- `owasp-documents/OWASP-GenAI-COMPASS-RunBook-1.0.pdf` — reviewed for COMPASS/OODA workflow and framework alignment.
- `owasp-documents/OWASP-GenAI-Data-Security-Risks-and-Mitigations-2026-v1.0.pdf` — `DSGAI01–DSGAI21` extracted and mapped. The document narrative references `DSGAI01–DSGAI25`; discrepancy remains tracked.
- `owasp-documents/OWASP-Top-10-for-Agentic-Applications-2026-12.6.pdf` — `ASI01–ASI10` extracted and mapped.
- `owasp-documents/OWASP-Top10-for-Agentic-Applications_AIUC-1-Crosswalk-May26.pdf` — reviewed for Primary/Secondary relevance methodology and strategic gaps.
- `owasp-documents/State-of-Agentic-AI-Security-and-Governance-v2.01.pdf` — reviewed for governance maturity, adoption-tier prioritisation, identity/NHI, AI SBOM/provenance, and runtime governance themes.

Source category names are confirmed for `DSGAI01–DSGAI21` and `ASI01–ASI10`. GenAI Security coverage is now a working starter backed by safe synthetic scenario manifests, deterministic evaluators, and CI validation; it is still not certified assurance.

## Documentation maintenance rule

When production posture or assessment coverage changes, update these together:

1. `README.md`
2. `SECURITY.md`
3. `docs/README.md`
4. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
5. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
6. `docs/genai/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`
7. `docs/AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`
8. `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`
9. `docs/PRODUCTION_HARDENING_BACKLOG.md`
10. `docs/ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md`
11. `docs/owasp/OWASP_TO_MITRE_ATLAS_CROSSWALK.md`
12. `docs/genai/`
13. `docs/agentic/`
14. `docs/owasp-documents/`
15. `CHANGELOG.md`

If a capability is starter-level, partial, experimental, accepted risk, source discrepancy, or roadmap-only, mark it clearly in every document that mentions it.
