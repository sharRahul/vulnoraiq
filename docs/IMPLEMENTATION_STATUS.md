# Implementation Status

This document separates current working capability from roadmap items so users can understand what is ready today.

> **Current maturity:** VulnoraIQ version `0.2.0` has passed the **controlled internal enterprise production-readiness gate** with security hardening, SQLite persistence, auth, CSRF, rate limiting, audit logging, metrics, backup/restore tooling, container support, production startup validation, and completed Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan phases 0-8. It is **not ready for public internet-facing, multi-tenant SaaS, or unsupervised production hosting** without additional controls such as OIDC/SSO, horizontal scaling, external penetration testing, WAF/CDN/DDoS protection, HA persistence, and tenant isolation. See [`AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md), [`PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`](PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md), and [`ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md`](ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md) for boundaries and limitations.

> **Important limitation:** OWASP LLM 2025 coverage now has implementation specs, safe starter oracle coverage, deterministic local evaluator primitives, and local good/bad fixtures for all 10 categories. MITRE ATLAS AI technique coverage now has a source-driven planning matrix and unmapped backlog preservation, but the matrix is not the same as active production-validated detection coverage. MITRE ATLAS-derived documentation is tracked in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Treat output as development evidence, not validated security assurance or certified VAPT output.

## Seven-phase implementation status

| Phase | Status | Completed implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 — OWASP depth | Working-alpha starter | `docs/owasp/` contains implementation specs for all 10 OWASP LLM 2025 categories. |
| Phase 2 — Safe demo fixtures | Working-alpha starter | `examples/local_demo_targets/owasp_fixture_targets.py` models local good/bad control behaviour for all 10 categories. |
| Phase 3 — Stronger evaluators | Working-alpha starter | `core/evaluators.py` adds deterministic local evaluators for text checks, schema checks, source access, provenance, approval, citations, action boundaries, resource limits, and manual review. |
| Phase 4 — Contract-tested adapters | Working starter | `config/target_contracts.yaml` and `integrations/contract_validation.py` validate configured target adapter shapes before authorised testing. |
| Phase 5 — Web UI hardening | Controlled-internal production ready | `webui/hosted_server.py`, `webui/auth.py`, `webui/persistent_jobs.py`, and `webui/production_checks.py` provide the hardened Web UI with env-token auth, trusted proxy identity mode, CSRF, rate limiting, security headers, proxy trust, audit logging, metrics, request IDs, concurrency limits, and startup validation. |
| Phase 6 — Report quality and presentation | Working starter | Report generation includes structured evidence; `reports/html_export_package.py` builds a branded export bundle; `docs/assets/vulnoraiq-dashboard-example.svg` provides a README dashboard example image. |
| Phase 7 — Release gates | Controlled-internal production ready | `scripts/validate_package_metadata.py`, `scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py`, `scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py`, backup/restore scripts, Docker smoke tooling, and CI gates validate package, runtime, docs, readiness, and functional acceptance. |

## Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan

| Scope | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controlled internal enterprise deployment phases 0-8 | Complete | [`AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md), `scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` |
| Public internet / SaaS hardening phase 9 | Deferred | Tracked as future backlog in [`PRODUCTION_HARDENING_BACKLOG.md`](PRODUCTION_HARDENING_BACKLOG.md) and the Agentic readiness plan. |

## Current safe usage

Run the Web UI in development mode:

```bash
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Run the Web UI in production mode:

```bash
VULNORAIQ_ENV=production \
VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true \
VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="your-strong-token-min-20-chars" \
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Validate production config before starting:

```bash
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
```

Run backup:

```bash
python scripts/backup_sqlite_store.py \
  /data/jobs.db \
  /data/backups/jobs-$(date +%Y%m%d).db \
  --compress \
  --validate \
  --retention 90
```

Validate production readiness:

```bash
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py \
  --run-functional \
  --output-dir reports/output/production-readiness \
  --screenshot docs/assets/vulnoraiq-dashboard-example.svg
```

For any configured target outside demo mode:

1. Confirm the target is owned by you or explicitly approved for assessment.
2. Replace the placeholder endpoint in `config/targets.yaml`.
3. Validate target contracts before testing.
4. Set any required token environment variable.
5. Run with the CLI authorisation flag or tick the Web UI authorisation confirmation.
6. Treat results as experimental until OWASP and ATLAS coverage checks are validated.
7. Store reports securely and review evidence before sharing.

## Implementation roadmap status

All production hardening blockers PRD-001 through PRD-011 are closed for controlled internal enterprise deployment. The Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan is complete for phases 0-8. The project has gate-level 10/10 controlled-internal readiness, while the detailed scorecard remains lower where non-blocking improvements are still tracked.

The next phases should focus on:

- Public internet / SaaS / multi-tenant readiness: OIDC/JWT-native identity, tenant isolation, WAF/CDN/DDoS controls, distributed rate limiting, HA persistence, and external penetration testing.
- Scanner/evaluator depth: deeper check logic, evaluator thresholds, fixture realism, and real-world validation.
- Report language and assurance validation for real-world VAPT claims.

## Documentation rule

README, `SECURITY.md`, and all top-level docs must remain aligned. If a capability is only a starter, placeholder, partial, experimental, accepted risk, or roadmap item, mark it as such everywhere it appears.
