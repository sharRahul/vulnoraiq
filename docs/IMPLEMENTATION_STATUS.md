# Implementation Status

This document separates current complete capability from future assurance and maturity items so users can understand what is ready today.

> **Current maturity:** VulnoraIQ version `0.2.0` has passed the **controlled internal production-readiness gate** for self-hosted laptop/server use, with security hardening, SQLite persistence, auth, CSRF, rate limiting, audit logging, metrics, backup/restore tooling, container support, standalone local launchers, production startup validation, completed OWASP LLM readiness coverage for the current safe local/internal scope, completed OWASP AI Testing Guide methodology-harness integration, completed Agentic Applications readiness gates, and completed GenAI Security scenario-harness readiness for `DSGAI01–DSGAI21`.

> **Important limitation:** OWASP LLM 2025, OWASP AI Testing Guide, GenAI Security, Agentic Applications, and MITRE ATLAS mappings are framework evidence and planning/validation controls. They are not the same as independently validated assurance. Treat output as development and internal assessment evidence requiring human review.

## Current safe usage

Run the standalone local Web UI launcher for laptop/workstation use:

```bash
python launch-vulnoraiq-webui.py
```

Or double-click the platform launcher from the repository root:

- Windows: `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.bat`
- macOS: `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.command`
- Linux: `launch-vulnoraiq-webui.sh`

Run the Web UI in production mode for a self-hosted internal server:

```bash
VULNORAIQ_ENV=production \
VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true \
VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="your-strong-token-min-20-chars" \
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Validate production and assessment readiness:

```bash
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py \
  --run-functional \
  --output-dir reports/output/production-readiness
```

For any configured target outside demo mode:

1. Confirm the target is owned by you or explicitly approved for assessment.
2. Replace the placeholder endpoint in `config/targets.yaml` or start a local lab target that matches one of the `owasp_lab_*` loopback templates.
3. Validate target contracts before testing.
4. Set any required token environment variable.
5. Run with the CLI authorisation flag or tick the Web UI authorisation confirmation.
6. Treat results as framework evidence requiring human review.
7. Store reports securely and review evidence before sharing.

## Implementation roadmap status

All production hardening blockers PRD-001 through PRD-012 are closed for self-hosted internal deployment. The OWASP LLM 2025 safe local/internal readiness scope is complete for all 10 categories. The OWASP AI Testing Guide foundation suite is complete for the current controlled methodology-harness scope. The Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan is complete for the intended laptop/server application model. The GenAI Security Production Readiness Plan is complete for `DSGAI01–DSGAI21` controlled internal readiness. The standalone local launcher path is complete for laptop/workstation use.

The next phases should focus on:

- Scanner/evaluator depth: deeper OWASP and GenAI check logic, evaluator thresholds, fixture realism, and approved environment validation.
- Signed/packaged installer artifacts for laptop/server installation rather than repository-checkout launchers only.
- Target adapter templates for AI agents, LLM APIs, RAG systems, and local model servers.
- Report language and assurance validation for stronger claims.

Scanner and evaluator assurance limitations are documented in [`docs/ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md`](ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md).

## Documentation rule

README, `SECURITY.md`, and all top-level docs must remain aligned. If a capability is complete only for the current self-hosted/internal scope, source discrepancy, accepted risk, future maturity item, or assurance limitation, mark that clearly everywhere it appears.
