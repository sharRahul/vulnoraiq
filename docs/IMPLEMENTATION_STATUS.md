# Implementation Status

This document separates current working capability from roadmap items so users can understand what is ready today.

> **Current maturity:** VulnoraIQ version `0.2.0` has passed the **controlled internal enterprise production-readiness gate** with security hardening, SQLite persistence, auth, CSRF, rate limiting, audit logging, metrics, backup/restore tooling, container support, production startup validation, completed Agentic Applications readiness phases 0-8, and a completed GenAI Security working-starter readiness gate for `DSGAI01–DSGAI21`. It is **not ready for public internet-facing, multi-tenant SaaS, unsupervised production hosting, or certified VAPT-grade assurance** without additional controls such as OIDC/SSO, horizontal scaling, external testing, WAF/CDN/DDoS protection, HA persistence, tenant isolation, and independent assurance.

> **Important limitation:** OWASP LLM 2025, GenAI Security, Agentic Applications, and MITRE ATLAS mappings are framework evidence and planning/validation controls. They are not the same as independent production-validated detection assurance. Treat output as development and internal assessment evidence requiring human review.

## Seven-phase implementation status

| Phase | Status | Completed implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 — OWASP depth | Working-alpha starter | `docs/owasp/` contains implementation specs for all 10 OWASP LLM 2025 categories. |
| Phase 2 — Safe demo fixtures | Working-alpha starter | `examples/local_demo_targets/owasp_fixture_targets.py` models local good/bad control behaviour for all 10 categories. |
| Phase 3 — Stronger evaluators | Working-alpha starter | `core/evaluators.py` adds deterministic local evaluators for text checks, schema checks, source access, provenance, approval, citations, action boundaries, resource limits, and manual review. |
| Phase 4 — Contract-tested adapters | Working starter | `config/target_contracts.yaml` and `integrations/contract_validation.py` validate configured target adapter shapes before authorised testing. |
| Phase 5 — Web UI hardening | Controlled-internal production ready | `webui/hosted_server.py`, `webui/auth.py`, `webui/persistent_jobs.py`, and `webui/production_checks.py` provide the hardened Web UI with env-token auth, trusted proxy identity mode, CSRF, rate limiting, security headers, proxy trust, audit logging, metrics, request IDs, concurrency limits, and startup validation. |
| Phase 6 — Report quality and presentation | Working starter | Report generation includes structured evidence; `reports/html_export_package.py` builds a branded export bundle; `docs/assets/vulnoraiq-dashboard-example.svg` provides a README dashboard example image. |
| Phase 7 — Release gates | Controlled-internal production ready | Package metadata, GenAI readiness, OWASP/ATLAS mapping, production readiness, runtime config, backup/restore, Docker smoke tooling, and CI gates validate package, runtime, docs, readiness, and functional acceptance. |

## Current safe usage

Run the Web UI in production mode:

```bash
VULNORAIQ_ENV=production \
VULNORAIQ_AUTH_ENABLED=true \
VULNORAIQ_ADMIN_TOKEN="your-strong-token-min-20-chars" \
vulnoraiq-web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Validate production and assessment readiness:

```bash
python scripts/validate_runtime_production_config.py
python scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py
python scripts/validate_genai_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py
python scripts/validate_production_testing_readiness.py \
  --run-functional \
  --output-dir reports/output/production-readiness \
  --screenshot docs/assets/vulnoraiq-dashboard-example.svg
```

For any configured target outside demo mode:

1. Confirm the target is owned by you or explicitly approved for assessment.
2. Replace the placeholder endpoint in `config/targets.yaml`.
3. Validate target contracts before testing.
4. Set any required token environment variable.
5. Run with the CLI authorisation flag or tick the Web UI authorisation confirmation.
6. Treat results as framework evidence requiring human review.
7. Store reports securely and review evidence before sharing.

## Implementation roadmap status

All production hardening blockers PRD-001 through PRD-012 are closed for controlled internal enterprise deployment. The Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan is complete for phases 0-8. The GenAI Security Production Readiness Plan is complete at working-starter level for `DSGAI01–DSGAI21` controlled internal readiness.

The next phases should focus on:

- Public internet / SaaS / multi-tenant readiness: OIDC/JWT-native identity, tenant isolation, WAF/CDN/DDoS controls, distributed rate limiting, HA persistence, and external testing.
- Scanner/evaluator depth: deeper OWASP and GenAI check logic, evaluator thresholds, fixture realism, and authorised real-world validation.
- Report language and assurance validation for external claims.

Scanner and evaluator assurance limitations are documented in [`docs/ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md`](ASSESSMENT_ASSURANCE.md).

## Documentation rule

README, `SECURITY.md`, and all top-level docs must remain aligned. If a capability is only a starter, placeholder, partial, experimental, accepted risk, source discrepancy, or roadmap item, mark it as such everywhere it appears.
