# MITRE ATLAS Matrix for AI Systems

This file is the VulnoraIQ implementation planning register for MITRE ATLAS tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques.

> **Generated snapshot:** this checked-in snapshot is generated from the official MITRE ATLAS v6 source path used by VulnoraIQ: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-atlas/atlas-data/main/dist/v6/ATLAS-2026.05.yaml`.

> **Third-party notice:** MITRE ATLAS data is copyright 2021-2026 MITRE and licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. VulnoraIQ's use of MITRE ATLAS data does not imply endorsement by MITRE. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

> **Mapping rule:** if a tactic or technique cannot be confidently mapped to OWASP or a VulnoraIQ coverage area, it is still listed and marked `Unmapped / map later`. No ATLAS item should disappear just because it is not mapped yet.

> **Drift-control rule:** regenerate this file with `scripts/generate_mitre_atlas_matrix.py` and keep unmapped rows visible until they are deliberately mapped, excluded, or documented for later review.

## Techniques and sub-techniques

> The complete generated technique table should be regenerated from `scripts/generate_mitre_atlas_matrix.py` before deeper ATLAS implementation work. Keep regenerated IDs visible, including `Unmapped / map later` rows, so later implementation planning does not silently drop ATLAS coverage.
