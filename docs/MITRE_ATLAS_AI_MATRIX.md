# MITRE ATLAS Matrix for AI Systems

This file is the VulnoraIQ implementation planning register for MITRE ATLAS tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques.

> **Generated snapshot:** this checked-in snapshot is generated from the official MITRE ATLAS v6 source path used by VulnoraIQ: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-atlas/atlas-data/main/dist/v6/ATLAS-2026.05.yaml`.

> **Third-party notice:** MITRE ATLAS data is copyright 2021-2026 MITRE and licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. VulnoraIQ's use of MITRE ATLAS data does not imply endorsement by MITRE. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

> **Mapping rule:** if a tactic or technique cannot be confidently mapped to OWASP or a VulnoraIQ coverage area, it is still listed and marked `Unmapped / map later`. No ATLAS item should disappear just because it is not mapped yet.

## Unmapped / map later backlog

These entries are intentionally preserved so future VulnoraIQ work can map them later rather than losing them during generation.

## Drift-control rule

Future changes must not manually remove generated tactic or technique rows. Update the official source version or generator, regenerate this file, then update VulnoraIQ configuration and payload plans against the regenerated IDs. Unmapped entries must stay visible until deliberately mapped or excluded with documented rationale.
