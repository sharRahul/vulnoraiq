# Production Hardening Backlog

Status: live blocker register
Current operational readiness: 10/10 (controlled internal deployment)
Target: controlled production assessment readiness, not SaaS multi-tenant production hosting.

## Current verdict

VulnoraIQ is ready for **controlled internal enterprise deployment** with the security, operational, and deployment controls listed below. The Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan is **complete for phases 0-8** under this controlled-internal scope. It is **not ready for public internet-facing, multi-tenant SaaS, or unsupervised production hosting**. See [`PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`](PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md) for detailed scoring and remaining gaps, and [`AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`](AGENTIC_APPLICATIONS_PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md) for the phase-by-phase implementation gate.

## Closed blockers (completed in production hardening tranche)

| ID | Area | Required outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRD-001 | Logging | Structured application logging with request, job, scan, error, and audit events. | `webui/hosted_server.py` — structured JSON-line audit logging with request IDs, 15+ audited event types; `tests/test_webui_audit_logging.py` |
| PRD-002 | Web server | Documented reverse-proxy or ASGI/WSGI production deployment path. | `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — nginx/Caddy reverse proxy configs; `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — proxy verification steps |
| PRD-003 | Web UI consolidation | One supported web runtime with legacy paths removed. | `webui/server.py` removed; only `webui/hosted_server.py` remains |
| PRD-004 | Authentication | Auth enabled for non-local deployments, env/secret token source, no shared credentials. | `webui/auth.py` — env-driven token auth, hmac compare, production-mode validation; `tests/test_webui_auth_production.py` |
| PRD-005 | Web hardening | CSRF, rate limiting, security headers, request limits. | `webui/hosted_server.py` — CSRF with TTL/cleanup, rate limiting, CSP/HSTS/XFO headers, 10MB request limit; `tests/test_webui_csrf.py`, `tests/test_webui_rate_limit.py`, `tests/test_webui_security_headers.py` |
| PRD-006 | Configuration | Environment-variable overrides for all runtime paths. | `webui/hosted_server.py` — VULNORAIQ_CONFIG_DIR, VULNORAIQ_WEB_OUTPUT_ROOT, VULNORAIQ_JOB_STORE_PATH, VULNORAIQ_WEB_USERS_PATH, etc. |
| PRD-007 | Persistence | SQLite-backed job persistence with migrations. | `webui/persistent_jobs.py` — SqliteJobStore with WAL, foreign keys, schema versioning; `tests/test_sqlite_job_store.py` |
| PRD-008 | Containerisation | Deployable container baseline. | `Dockerfile` — non-root user, /data volume, healthcheck; `.dockerignore`; `docker-compose.yml` |
| PRD-009 | Quality gates | Ruff, mypy, CI enforcement. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` — ruff check, mypy, pytest, metadata validation |
| PRD-010 | Observability | Health, readiness, metrics endpoints. | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` in `webui/hosted_server.py`; `tests/test_metrics.py` |
| PRD-011 | Agentic mapping governance | CI fails if any active oracle/check lacks OWASP family, OWASP ID, MITRE ATLAS tactic, mapping status, evidence surface, or manual-review flag. | `scripts/validate_owasp_atlas_mappings.py`; `tests/test_owasp_atlas_mapping_validation.py`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` |

## Current controlled-internal readiness (scored at 10/10)

All blockers PRD-001 through PRD-011 are **Closed**. See [`PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`](PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md) for detailed section scoring.

## Remaining gaps for public internet / SaaS / multi-tenant

| Area | Gap | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TLS termination | Relies on reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy); not built-in | Medium |
| Horizontal scaling | No shared-nothing / stateless design | High |
| OIDC/SSO | Proxy-header identity only; no direct OIDC | Medium |
| Database HA | SQLite is single-file; requires NAS/backup | Low |
| Full audit trail | Missing user-management events (create/delete/role-change) | Low |
| Penetration testing | No third-party pentest results | High |
| Multi-tenancy | No tenant isolation or per-tenant config | High |
| Rate limiting per-user | IP-based only; not per-authenticated-user | Medium |
| Secrets rotation | Documented but no automated rotation tool | Medium |

### Notes on scoring

The 10/10 gate-compliance score means all PRD-001 through PRD-011 blockers are closed. The actual scorecard average for controlled internal deployment is **8.5/10** (see [`PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`](PRODUCTION_READINESS_SCORECARD.md)), reflecting remaining non-blocking maturity items such as SIEM integration, OIDC, signed releases, SAST/DAST, public/SaaS architecture, and independent assurance.

## Production claim rule

Do not describe VulnoraIQ as public-internet or multi-tenant SaaS ready until the remaining gaps above are addressed. Controlled internal deployment readiness is attested by this register, the scorecard, the completed Agentic Applications Production Readiness Plan, and the production-readiness validation gate.
