# Production hardening backlog

Status: live blocker and maturity register  
Current operational readiness: 10/10 for the current self-hosted internal deployment scope  
Target: Docker-first laptop/workstation/internal-server assessment lab.

## Current verdict

VulnoraIQ is complete for the current self-hosted internal deployment scope with Docker-first lab startup, authorised target adapters, React WebUI target management, SQLite persistence, auth/security hardening, audit/metrics, OWASP/GenAI/Agentic/MITRE governance, and CI gates.

Self-hosted internal deployment readiness is attested by this blocker register, the production-readiness scorecard, the implementation status, the assessment assurance boundary, the release gates, and the CI validators.

The current release claim remains:

> Self-hosted laptop/server AI security testing application with controlled internal production-readiness gate passed.

This does not mean certified VAPT-grade assurance or independently validated real-world GenAI detection coverage.

## Closed blockers

## Production claim rule

Allowed wording must stay scoped to self-hosted/internal readiness. Stronger claims should wait for the future maturity items above.
